    The brooooader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be derived from the novel catalyst developed of the project. The project will, if successful, dramatically improve the efficiency and scope of a specific class of industrially significant chemical reactions which are indispensable for the manufacture of many useful products such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and electronics. The improvements, for example, will provide access to newer materials for the production of newer and improved related products to address unmet biological and engineering needs. The catalyst discoveries will also enhance the scientific knowledge base of both fundamental and applied catalysis science.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop a collection of novel and improved organometallic catalysts for industrially relevant cross-coupling reactions; and to address current unmet industrial needs for higher catalyst efficiency, selectivity and scope of these reactions. The Phase I research will involve detailed and innovative investigations of the current state-of-the-art catalysts; systematic and iterative design, synthesis, and testing of the new organometallic catalysts; and demonstration of improved performance of the new catalysts in relevant cross-coupling reactions. The catalysis knowledge gained from this Phase I research will enable catalyst design and development efforts in the current project for specific industrial applications. The development and commercialization of a collection of new and improved catalysts in this Phase I project will significantly expand the efficiency and industrial utility of cross- coupling reactions towards creating new products based on this chemistry.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase I project is to develop an effective cost saving screening technology
    based on molecular modeling for separating molecules that are identical except
    for geometric differences, that are present in the development of pure orphan
    drugs.  The separation of these molecules from one another is both important and
    challenging, since while one molecular form can have beneficial therapeutic value,
    the other molecular form can at best be benign but often can also be toxic. The
    implementation of this proposed strategy should have a significant impact on the
    rapid development of new medicines especially those being formulated by drug manufacturers
    with limited R&D resources. Ultimately, a successful outcome from this project
    will accelerate drug discovery in pharmaceutical companies and allow for unique
    drug formulations to be available in the market to consumers that are relying
    on them for treatment and to extend their life.  \n\nThe technical objectives
    in this Phase I research project are to develop a predictive molecular model which
    can guide experimentation in purifying chiral molecules for pharmaceutical companies
    to use in drug formulations. Over the past decade, the efforts in the pharmaceutical
    community have shifted to studying pure chiral drugs rather than racemic mixtures
    due to the discovery that certain enantiomers may have negative implications on
    the human body by causing toxicity or certain defects. Owed to the possibility
    of harmful side effects from racemic mixtures, the commercial focus has turned
    to purifying pharmaceutical drugs to create an enantio-pure chiral product. The
    modeling tools to be built will take advantage of significant proprietary data
    Orochem has developed in the past few years as part of their R&D activities in
    developing new and innovative methods for the separation of racemic mixtures of
    enantiomers. The initial molecular model will demonstrate interaction between
    a Chiral Stationary Phase, mobile phase, and enantiomers known to be resolved
    by the particular system.  The dynamic model will allow examination of conformations
    of the enantiomer within the chiral separation system in a more detailed fashion
    since molecular modeling input parameters include detail on the bond, angle, and
    dihedral energies present in molecules of the racemate. Overall, molecular simulations
    of chromatographic separations will lessen the time of discovery of systems for
    separating these chiral isomers by leading experimental investigation and aiding
    research scientists at pharmaceutical companies to identify suitable chiral stationary
    phases apriori. This will reduce both the cost and time of bringing new drugs
    to market."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase-I project is in the development of low cost, environmentally-friendly coating materials for corrosion prevention. Corrosion is a significant global issue, resulting in high maintenance and repair costs. Current anti-corrosion coatings need an improvement in effective barrier against water or moisture. As a result, it is imperative to develop improved corrosion resistance coatings, leading to reduced downtime and damage to equipment and important infrastructure. This study aims to achieve the desired level of barrier properties necessary to significantly improve passive protection of the coated surface. These coating material developed will be sustainable and will use low cost clay as fillers to replace expensive Zinc fillers in coating formulations, completely or partially. The developed technology will have the potential to reduce damages due to corrosion in spectrum of industries spanning infrastructure, shipping, food containers, defense, and automobile domains. Primary fillers used will be non-toxic, abundantly available, versatile, low-cost, and easily adaptable with current coating manufacturing protocols, making them commercially viable. Successful completion of project phase I & II will result in advanced manufacturing job creation and reduce corrosion related costs in industry and improve infrastructure lifetime.

    The technical objective of this STTR Phase-I proposal is developing a platform technology for multi- functional low cost epoxy-based nanocomposite coatings for corrosion protection. The innovation in the proposed multi-functional coatings lay in deriving the benefits of various fillers and a combinatorial approach to synergistic harvesting of functionality and robustness. Polymer nanocomposites provide an opportunity to harness the maximum benefits of properties when fillers are uniformly dispersed in the host matrix. The structural integrity of metal and its products is directly dependent on its anti-corrosive properties, which can be enhanced using modified clay as fillers. Passive and active protection against corrosion reaction can be achieved by using transition metal ion modified clay as a filler coupled with dispersion and improved polymer-filler interactions. As part of this STTR Phase-I award we will optimize the formulations such that corrosion resistance and other key properties of coatings are enhanced. The validated corrosion resistance coatings will then be translated towards commercial success by: i) producing and benchmarking novel coating formulations for corrosion resistance, ii) scaling-up the production process, iii) mathematical modeling for recursive design of these coatings. At end of the project we will have a superior low cost multi-functional coating with lower toxic footprint.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the potential to overcome some of the current
    lack of similar devices for screening and monitoring of PAD and will allow greater
    access at lower cost for current and future patients suffering from PAD. Today,
    hospitalization costs for diagnosis and treatment of PAD patients exceed $10,000
    per patient for 8 to 10 million Americans suffering from lower-extremity PAD.
    The current options for PAD diagnosis are too expensive and impractical to monitor
    or diagnose the condition in its early stages before it is too late to initiate
    therapy to reverse or slow progress. Regular screening as well as monitoring of
    PAD after an initial diagnosis by medical professionals has the potential to significantly
    reduce the current cost of managing PAD patients, including prevention of many
    of the 150,000 ischemic amputations performed annually in the US through early
    intervention. \n\nThe proposed project addresses the need for a more practical,
    accessible, user-friendly, and inexpensive technique, for monitoring PAD. The
    proposed our transdermal gasotransmitter sensor employs an innovative, patented
    gas-phase detector to non-invasively provide real-time measure of the target molecule.
    It is anticipated that this approach would provide accurate, cost-effective monitoring
    of onset and severity through monitoring plasma H2S levels, which could also enable
    subsequent therapeutic measures in real-time. During this Phase I study, a prototype
    of a TGS module will be developed and its performance will be demonstrated. Prior
    data and results will be utilized to design and develop a breadboard prototype
    for remote gasotransmitter monitoring. Key technical challenges of developing
    a disposable sensor will be addressed, including size, cost, and ease of use.
    Feasibility will be tested under simulated laboratory conditions with membranes
    and animal skin. Furthermore, the breadboard prototype will be implemented in
    ongoing studies on healthy and diabetic rats. Building on Phase I findings, more
    advanced prototype development and further testing is planned for Phase II efforts."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project to develop short term Solar irradiance forecasting, will be to support very large deployment of Solar photovoltaic (SPV) generation capacity, by reducing the cost of mitigating cloud caused fluctuation of SPV electricity generation. This increased SPV system deployment will reduce the amount of base load and peaking generation from greenhouse gas causing, and water consuming fossil fuel generators. Such forecasting will enable development of pre-­&#8208; mitigation strategies instead of post mitigation using electrical storage systems. Prior studies indicate that this will result in the reduction by up to a factor of five, of the input/output requirements of the electrical storage system used in the pre-­&#8208;mitigation scenario, compared to the post mitigation scenario. These benefits will be seen with grid-­&#8208;tied, micro-­&#8208;grid and off-­&#8208;grid SPV systems. This opens commercial opportunities for introducing intelligent sensors and control systems to reduce bulk electrical storage. The technology areas used in this project include sensors, 3D printing, neural network based learning systems, embedded computers and cloud computing. The market sectors that will see a positive impact include all demographics as consumers, and manufacturers of SPV modules and SPV balance of system suppliers.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project  addresses  the  problem  of  mitigating cloud movement induced fluctuation in the output of SPV systems. The research objectives of Phase I are (a) prototype a whole sky imager that provides sufficient circumsolar image discrimination, to drive a neural network based learning system ? this will require  development  of  a  3D-­&#8208;printed  mounting system for a whole sky sensor, and interface to a cloud connected, local single board computer, (b) develop and optimize Image Acquisition, Compositing, Analysis, and Forecasting Algorithms to provide 15-­&#8208;500 second forecasts of Solar irradiance, and (c) deploy imager + software prototypes to evaluate real live sky imagery in multiple locations with different weather patterns, by gathering data to ?train? the neural network. It is anticipated that this evaluation and analysis of prototype performance will continue in subsequent phases, to obtain high confidence results. The anticipated results of the research in Phase I  are (i) refinement of the image capture system to produce ?good? imagery, (ii) development  of procedures  to  tune  neural  network  learning  system  towards  obtaining  high  confidence  forecasts, and (iii) understanding of performance requirements of local single board computer.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to protect consumer privacy while continuing
    to enable the ad-supported Internet model. Current tracking-based consumer targeting
    approaches inherently erode consumer privacy, surreptitiously tracking users across
    many different web sites in an effort to gather demographic and behavioral data.
    On the flip side of the coin, marketers need to collect such data to successfully
    reach their audiences, and the revenue that marketers pour into advertising online
    has become an essential component of the economics of the internet. Today, this
    delicate balance of competing pros and cons is further threatened by the rise
    of ad-blocking software, which erodes the value of internet ad placement. The
    video marketing analytics capability developed in this project will limit marketers'
    need for invasive consumer data, while improving consumer experience. In the commercial
    realm, marketers would value the opportunity to target their ads in the most emotionally
    consonant, least disruptive, and most engaging manner possible. This technology
    will provide marketers with the capability to watch millions of videos algorithmically,
    thus enabling a more streamlined and customized viewer experience than has ever
    before been possible on television or on the Internet. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop commercial applications for
    Perceptual Annotation, a technology developed with NSF funding that allows detailed
    measurements of human performance to be infused into a machine learning process,
    allowing the machine learner to both perform better and to perform in a way that
    is more consistent with humans. By adding this new category of human-derived supervisory
    signal into a machine learning process, the proposers have demonstrated that it
    is possible to significantly boost machine vision performance, allowing machines
    to generalize better to new, previously unseen images. While the company's technology
    has been rigorously validated on large-scale \"in the wild\" academic datasets,
    a major technical drive in the proposed SBIR Phase I activities will be to shift
    the company's efforts to the analysis of \"live,\" enormous, and ever-expanding
    data sets such as online videos. A second major drive of the proposed Phase I
    work will be the construction of \"second stage\" machine learning models that
    take perceptual-annotation-based machine ratings as an input and output actionable
    marketing decisions."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to trigger a major shift toward mobile content across the marketing industry - broadening the market and generating larger economic impact. Massive amounts of media dollars are poised to shift toward mobile video, but will not flow freely until ads can be delivered on the right content (engaging and safe) to the right people (targeted consumer segments) at the right time (when consumers are actively engaged). This SBIR Phase I project will radically advance the scientific and technological understanding needed for marketers to deliver ads this way, thereby enabling them to build their brands with sight, sound, and motion content delivered surgically through the most personal and engaging channel available - mobile. With the project facilitating this transition: 1) brands will be able to advertise more efficiently across TV and mobile media; 2) content producers, now able to extract fair market value for their efforts, will be motivated to create more and better content; and 3) audiences will benefit from improved content quality, selection and accessibility.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to enable brands and agencies to quickly and efficiently extend TV media plans into the rapidly growing mobile video space. While marketers have sophisticated TV planning tools at their disposal, they currently lack the ability to integrate TV/mobile video advertising in a way that optimizes their audience engagement and media spend. The research objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop social media-based recommendation technology to help marketers plan mobile video ad campaigns that seamlessly integrate with their traditional TV campaigns. The proposed project will 1) validate the technical and commercial feasibility of this approach and 2) produce an alpha version of the technology. Anticipated technical results include: building and testing a video content discovery engine; validating and implementing a planning system; initiating UI testing and user studies.

Over both phases, this proposal covers research and development (R&D) to create a robot pet companions with the potential to sell millions of units in the U.S. toy industry. The proposal also supports the development of R&D infrastructure that will be a critical component of the expansion in subsequent years to the U.S. pet industry (as a robot companion), which is larger and has less direct competition for robotic entrants. The first-generation robot product, a result of the Phase I project, will support science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and robot hobbyists of all ages by facilitating user-friendly modification of its hardware and software as well as the creation of users? own robots and behavioral programs. Given the interactive nature of these modifiable robots, they are likely to have a strong appeal to females, who are underrepresented in STEM fields. The project?s ultimate goal is to develop and market interactive robots that can improve the quality of life for anyone through companionship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop first-generation robot pets that will be ready to place in thousands of customers? hands and to situate the awarded company to grow to deliver millions of sophisticated robot pets across the world, including to the many people who cannot have pets.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a novel low-cost molecular filter for use in harsh environments. This is accomplished using commodity silica gel, commonly found as a desiccant in food packing, whose pores can be made to be only a few molecules wide. Accurate tuning of the size and shape of the silica gel pores enables certain molecules to pass through while others are block from passing. One promising application for these molecular filters is their use in grid-scale energy storage. Flow batteries have the ability to store city-sized quantities of renewable energy. However, they require the use of expensive molecular filters that are not easily replaced due to the harsh battery environments. The low-cost filters developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of flow batteries by as much as 30%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid. Low cost molecular filter also have commercial upside with the potential to capture a $1.3 billion dollar market. Because of this, this project is expected to generate nearly 20 jobs and $79 million dollars in tax revenue over the next 5 years.


    This SBIR Phase 1 Project is developing a molecularly selective sol-gel ceramic membrane that does not require calcination or high polymer loading but also does not fracture during compression in stack applications (e.g., fuel cells and flow batteries). This is accomplished by decoupling the selective region from the region of the membrane being compresses by the stack. These membranes will be utilized to improve the performance and reduce the costs of all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). These membranes require selective transport of hydronium ions but not vanadium ions. Size exclusion membranes must therefore have tight control over the pore size and size distribution, shape and network structure in order to selectively transport ions. Towards this end, sol-gel processing and surface chemistry modification will be utilized to maximize proton conductivity and limit vanadium ion permeability. Optimized membrane formulations must also have excellent chemical and mechanical stability; showing no degradation after hundreds of VRFB cycles. Finally, membranes must be scaled from lab size (1 cm2) to commercial size (630 cm2) while maintaining performance uniformity. The low-cost membranes developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of VRFBs by as much as 30%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid.

    with Superior Performance and Low Cost'
- abstractText: |-
    This SBIR Phase I project involves the development of a turn-key simulation platform to automate electromagnetic design and modeling. This involves the integration of state-of-the-art open-source simulation engines with intelligent control software and cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC). Its three main benefits are to: (1) cut design time by at least 50%, (2) reduce operating costs by an order of magnitude via savings in labor and capital-equipment expenses, and (3) improve device performance, form factor, and energy efficiency by more than 10%. This tool enables the advanced manufacturing of new kinds of photonic and optoelectronic devices in critical industries including telecommunications, photovoltaics, biomedicine, photolithography, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Its impact is to help propel US manufacturing competitiveness to the forefront of the $180B global photonics industry. This is the next generation of computer-aided design (CAD) tools.


    Simpetus will develop an on-demand, pay-per-use, cloud-based photonics simulation platform, built on top of state-of-the-art open-source electromagnetic simulation engines, to automate the design and prototyping of a range of photonic devices in critical industries including telecommunications, photovoltaics, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Phase I will involve developing a new Python application program interface (API), simulation templates for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), metamaterial split-ring resonators, and other common devices, as well as pre- and post-processing modules to enhance the productivity of our tools. This tool for research and development will be deployed on scalable, high-performance computing (HPC) in the public cloud. Work in Phase I will lay the groundwork for Phase II to develop the first turn-key simulation platform for advanced photonics manufacturing.

    and detection of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam. In the United States
    over 300,000 women are diagnosed and 40,000 women die from breast cancer every
    year. Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations
    in cost, sensitivity, accessibility, and convenience of existing screening technologies
    result in one third of breasts cancers getting missed at early stages. Since treatment
    for early stage cancer is an order of magnitude less costly than treatment for
    stage 3 and 4 cancers, there is a clear economic and societal benefit for the
    development of better breast cancer monitoring and screening tools. To address
    this challenge, the technology proposed in this project leverages the proven benefits
    of ultrasound imaging and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence
    to provide a regular and accessible self-monitoring tool that can quantify and
    track suspicious changes in breast tissue. The device portability, low cost, 2
    minute scan time, and automated analysis of breast image data will greatly increase
    the accessibility of breast cancer monitoring for women, which in turn stands
    to decrease the cost burden of this disease for the US healthcare system. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new tool for early detection and monitoring
    of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam (QSE) that combines a low-cost, compact
    3D ultrasound device and positioning accessory with artificial intelligence to
    empower women and their physicians with appropriate and actionable data.  The
    QSE technology proposed in this project operates independent of user skill and
    captures 3D volumetric images of the whole breast in 2 minutes.  The system architecture
    allows for simplified and low-cost ultrasound hardware that connects wirelessly
    to a smart phone/tablet and transfers captured data to secure cloud for advanced
    image processing and storage. The ultrasound scanner attaches to a positioning
    accessory for repeatable imaging that enables longitudinal 3D monitoring of abnormal
    growth using machine learning-based image analysis. The proposed Phase I R&D efforts
    focus on four objectives: (i) optimize electrical hardware and low-level imaging
    software for spatial resolution and image quality; (ii) build a QSE scanner that
    maximizes field of view and volumetric integrity; (iii) build a positioning accessory
    for positioning of the QSE scanner; (iv) demonstrate the longitudinal repeatability
    of QSE imaging by validating the alignment of 3D ultrasound volumes on a breast
    phantom."

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to design, build, test, and refine a cartridge of medicine for use with an inkjet printer for printing medicine that was developed with past NSF ERC support for academic research and I-Corps support for market research. Similar to how a conventional inkjet printer deposits small quantities of liquid ink on blank paper, the printer deposits precisely measured quantities of medicine on blank carriers to make the final pharmaceutical product. Due to its smaller size and relatively quick production times, the printer enables and is currently aimed at personalized medicine applications, wherein dosages and other product factors are customized to individual named patients by their medical practitioner and drug products are made for the patient to suit based on such a patient-specific prescription. The detailed development of medicine cartridges has not been attempted before, and is specifically pursued in this SBIR Phase I project to demonstrate cleanliness, address potential counterfeiting concerns, provide ease of use, and provide tracking if required. Such cartridges are envisioned to enhance the impact of printed medicine for personalized medicine applications, thereby improving the level of healthcare for this nation?s ill and creating a high-value just-in-time pharmaceutical production market.

    It is technologically very challenging to adapt the cartridge concept to pharmaceutical applications. These challenges include: the need for the cartridge to maintain cleanliness and integrity during storage and in use; the need to ensure that final products match required composition and dissolution profiles; the need to ensure that the contents of a cartridge are shelf-stable over its life; the prevention of any accidental introduction of impurities or deliberate counterfeiting; and the need to preclude operator error in wrong-substance or wrong-dose dispensing. Further challenges include the need to select and optimize cartridge size and form factors. Preliminary designs for cartridges have been identified, and this SBIR Phase I support will enable such designs to be built, tested and improved. Such cartridges will be filled with both inert materials and with certain specific drug substances identified as being of commercial interest. The cartridge and printer are planned to recognize each other to prevent operator transcription error. Testing for composition and impurities is planned with standard analytical chemistry techniques used in the pharmaceutical sector, such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass spectrometry. The end result is a robust and reliable cartridge, to transform personalized medicine for the better for everyone.

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project will support the development of a powerful
    new track-and-trace platform in the global fight against counterfeit products
    in high-risk supply chains. From pharmaceuticals to aviation to defense, many
    industries now face a growing problem with maintaining visibility to the authentic
    products in their supply chain, while identifying black market and grey market
    products that could harm their customers and have serious impacts on national
    security. This project will build on interdisciplinary research from materials
    science, photonics and information technology to create an innovative new platform
    that connects physical supply chains with digital supply chains through the use
    of covert codes that are placed onto products. These codes are printed using  nanoparticles
    that are only visible when exposed to a laser with very specific properties. The
    security platform that this research enables will provide U.S. industry with a
    robust new system for authenticating genuine products and maintaining visibility
    throughout the global supply chain. \n \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    Phase I project develops a system designed to thwart counterfeiting.  The system
    is based on 1) covert printed markings, carrying encoded information, that convert
    near infrared (NIR) excitation either to visible light or to shorter-wavelength
    NIR light, and 2) a proprietary reader-decoder system that is cyber-enabled to
    access secure data bases. The two major technical challenges addressed in this
    project both involve maximizing the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the system.
    \ The first challenge improves the long-term stability and up-converting nanoparticle
    payload-capacity of a novel, micro-emulsion (aqueous continuous-phase) ink. The
    second challenge creates micro- or nano-scale substrates that greatly amplify
    the up-conversion signal. Successfully overcoming these technical hurdles will
    significantly advance the readiness of the technology for commercialization and
    Phase II development. It is estimated that reaching the milestones specified within
    the specific research objectives will lead to a 250x enhancement of up-conversion
    intensity when using low excitation power densities. Such an enhancement would
    be transformational to the system and enable the use of lower laser powers in
    the reader/decoder device which in turn, would lower costs and greatly extend
    the utility of the system to, for example, a hand held, portable reader."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves Web, Mobile and IoT applications, which
    generate significant economic value for society. IoT applications alone will add
    about $2T in economic value over the next 10 years. However, in order to fully
    realize the economic potential, high value applications will need to be created
    and brought to the market at low cost and quickly. This project will develop products
    that will significantly reduce development cost, improve quality, and bring these
    applications to market faster. The proposed project will also have significant
    impact on computer science education. Given the growing interest in programming
    at high school and college levels, the project will produce software tools and
    educational material that students can use to build novel applications without
    needing to learn a wide variety of languages and tools to experiment with different
    mobile and IoT devices. Further, interest in IoT has given rise to the maker movement,
    where low cost software and hardware tools are being used to build smart objects.
    Tools produced by this project will further lower the barrier of entry for the
    maker community. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses
    the problem of developing IoT, Mobile and Web applications. Developing these applications
    is extremely challenging because of the differences in device capabilities, platform
    support (iOS vs. Android vs. Windows), and resources (memory, CPU, power). Building
    such applications often has meant rewriting a large percentage of the application
    code using different programming languages, tools, libraries and platform support.
    This has resulted in high development and management costs, inconsistent and poor
    product experience across platforms, and low software quality. This project addresses
    the problem by using a language-driven approach. In this approach, a new language
    is designed specifically to provide abstractions for the various forms of heterogeneity
    (including hardware, capability, resource and abstraction heterogeneities). Compilers
    and code generators use the semantic properties of the abstractions to generate
    code customized for each device. The Phase 1 project will develop tools and libraries
    for targeting the language for several mobile and IoT platforms. The outcome of
    Phase 1 will be a set of tools, which when given a program and a description of
    devices, will generate code for each device, distribute and install the binaries
    on each device, and manage the binaries for the devices."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is a significant advance in the production of hydrogen
    peroxide. The project, if successful, will yield an on-site electrolytic generation
    method that reduces the cost of peroxide production by up to 50% compared to the
    traditional centralized chemical process. By reducing cost, hydrogen peroxide
    can be used more widely as an oxidizer in bleaching, wastewater treatment, and
    other processes, ultimately lowering chlorine pollution by replacing chlorine-based
    oxidizers. The paper/pulp and textiles industry in particular will benefit from
    lower cost bleaching chemicals and reduced effluent treatment costs. The electrolytic
    method reduces environmental pollution and eliminates the need for transportation
    of explosive high concentration hydrogen peroxide. The innovative electrolyzer
    design used for hydrogen peroxide production will enhance the scientific knowledge
    base on how to build improved electrode structures that support multiphase flow,
    and may have applications in other industrial electrolysis systems, including
    the chlor-alkali process.\n \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate
    a scaled-up high efficiency alkaline hydrogen peroxide electrolyzer system. The
    most difficult challenge to overcome for scale-up relates to the electrode manufacturing
    process. The electrodes are made by coating a catalyst-containing ink onto a conductive
    substrate. The composition of the ink is non-standard, and has not been coated

    of the oxygen reduction electrode. The roll-to-roll manufactured electrodes will
    be tested in pilot-scale hardware to demonstrate their durability and performance.
    Manufacturing-friendly multilayer coatings will be developed and investigated
    to overcome challenges associated with multiphase flow. After completing pilot-scale
    electrode manufacturing, the electrolyzer stack will be assembled and tested at
    an experimental bleaching facility to ensure that the electrolytically-generated

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess the commercial viability of a new substrate material specifically designed for reducing the manufacturing complexity of stretchable electronics. Currently a $1.6 million market, stretchable electronics are expected to grow at a cumulative annual growth rate of 101.3% to reach $412 million in sales by 2023 due to the surge in wearable technologies, structural health monitoring devices, and medical diagnostic tools. In part, the current market size for stretchable electronics is limited by the immature manufacturing tools and techniques required, such as transfer- and nano-printing. The research and development funded by the Phase I SBIR could lead to a drastic reduction in manufacturing complexity, allowing stretchable electronic devices to be manufactured using current industry standard photolithographic techniques.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in the ability to create electronic substrate materials with intrinsic stiffness differences (those without laminated layers, patterned fillers, etc.) that are defined using standard lithography techniques. Specifically, these substrates can be spatially segregated into regions of low Young's modulus (the soft matrix) and regions of high Young's modulus (the stiff islands) with a difference in modulus between these two regions reaching ratios of 1000:1 (stiff:soft). In the initial work, demonstrations of these spatially-heterogeneous modulus substrates show that spatial resolution can be achieved at the millimeter scale, and can introduce localized strain across the substrate as a function of the patterned stiff regions. The objectives for this project are focused on (a) engineering an optimal starting substrate material with the desired properties for the soft region and (b) demonstrating microfabrication of micropatterned thin-film components (feature sizes < 20 microns) of  stiff regions introduced into the material. This Phase I grant will culminate in prototype thin-film electronic components which maintain electrical performance at high global strains, while also showing the capacity of the substrate materials to withstand the harsh thermal and chemical conditions observed during microfabrication.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is group chat technology that enables knowledge workers to collaborate more effectively than ever before. It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to them. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has two key research objectives: scaling the technology to work for teams of size 10,000+, and determining the feasibility of porting the technology to mobile. A major scalability research area is search. The company envisions the technology to be the primary place where decisions are made, and hence a primary place where knowledge is stored, so fast, full-text search is important, despite the fact that chat generates much more traffic than email. One research area on mobile is the HCI challenge of displaying rich options for conversation navigation on a small mobile screen. The problem is unique to this technology, since having long running, asynchronous conversations means that users do not typically read messages in a strictly chronological fashion. The company anticipates the Phase I grant will enable it to develop a working solution to the search scalability problem, and a working prototype of a performant and productive mobile user experience.

    are syntactically (grammatically) and semantically (word meaning) complex. Specifically,
    elementary and secondary science texts are often written 3 to 5 years beyond what

    often overwhelm students' working memory, preventing them from constructing accurate
    mental representations of the target concepts. Thus, this project will develop
    and test a personalizable e-reader with embedded reading and language support.
    The intellectual merit of the effort resides in its ability to improve science
    comprehension through personalized and adaptive content. This project will produce
    content and assessments targeting the Next Generation Science Standards on Global
    Climate Change. The customizable features will make fundamental science knowledge
    more accessible and interesting to students -- and thus the general public. Given
    these benefits, it has strong potential to support future generations of STEM
    professionals and a more scientifically literate citizenry. \n\n\nThis project
    will produce an innovative iOS reading app to support science learning.  The key
    innovation will be to make science content adaptable and adjustable for learners.
    This Phase I project has five technical goals: (a) create NGSS-aligned content;
    (b) write and test assessments using item response theory; (c) develop and test
    the back-end for the app, to include cloud-based SQL databases, content delivery
    network, and the application programming interface; (d) develop and test&#8232;the

    controller architecture; (e) conduct user testing with students and teachers to
    evaluate the usabilityand initial feasibility of SquidBooks. During Phase I, the
    SquidBooks team will address some technological challenges in bringing this innovation
    to market. The key features of the iOS app create a potential for unnecessary
    memory load. This technological challenge will be overcome by architecting the
    program to be highly preprocessed and modular. A second challenge is making scientific

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be to develop an effective new mosquito control product that works against both adult and immature vectors, drastically reducing the size of the vector population without reliance on conventional insecticides. It will consist of two components: a potent plant-derived attractant to lure adult vector mosquitoes and an insect development disruptor that locks larvae in a permanent state of immaturity, eventually resulting in death, and also renders exposed adults infertile. This product will reduce the impacts of mosquito-borne illnesses around the world, and reduce environmental contamination by cover sprays of hazardous conventional pesticides. This strategy could revolutionize area-wide mosquito control programs: by inducing a large proportion of mosquitoes within the target population to act as their own delivery mechanism for the control agent, the proposed product substantially increases the effective size of the treated area, making it operationally viable to effectively treat every larval habitat and adult resting site, even in urban areas with an overwhelming abundance of potential habitats. Because this product attracts and contaminates all key species of mosquitoes, it will become an invaluable tool for the $16B/yr global vector control market.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I project are designed to demonstrate feasibility of an auto-dissemination strategy to control mosquito populations via three mechanisms: 1) exposure to the formulation containing the disruptor sterilizes adults; 2) larval breeding sites contaminated by the disruptor during adult visits will produce no viable offspring; and 3) the disruptor passed between adults during interactions (mating) increases the proportion of sterile individuals in the population and unproductive larval habitats in the treated area. By manipulating mosquitoes to deliver the control agent to their own offspring and restricting the reproductive capacity of the adult population, this project will help to overcome the long historical prejudice in favor of adult-targeting chemical insecticides by demonstrating that larval-targeted measures can be used to suppress vector populations at reasonable cost, renewing scientific and commercial interest in such alternative strategies. To demonstrate feasibility of this approach, Phase I research will focus on evaluating the effects of the formulation on vector mosquitoes when exposure occurs through contact and/or ingestion; determining the capacity of female mosquitoes to deliver the formulation to larval habitats; and finally, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed auto-dissemination strategy in reducing vector populations in an endemic field setting.

    sensors, faster computational tools, and a better understanding of the true nature
    of quantum physics. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
    project will develop a deterministic, on-demand single photon source that will
    enable quantum networks to be deployed over large areas, something that currently
    is not possible. The company will prototype a novel quantum source design critical
    to the realization of quantum teleportation repeaters. These repeaters can enable
    the long-distance transmission of quantum states and are required for wide-area
    quantum networks. An on-demand single photon source with a single photon generation
    probability rate of greater than 20% will be demonstrated in this Phase I effort.
    If successful, this scalable design offers a direct path to the higher single-photon
    generation probability rates required for successful integration and demonstration
    of quantum teleportation repeaters."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop an improved permanent magnet that will allow cost reduction and/or vehicle weight reduction in automotive applications. This permanent magnet product will be fabricated from samarium cobalt magnetic particles that are encapsulated with a nanometer scale coating of iron or cobalt metal. Bonded permanent magnets manufactured using these nanostructured powders will have energy products at least 30% greater than samarium cobalt alone. This increase in performance means that the same motor can use 20% less magnetic material resulting in cost savings, weight savings, and reduction in the use of the critical rare earth element samarium. In addition, compact high-performance permanent magnets will help the United States reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emission with no adverse effect on vehicle performance.

    The technical objective in this Phase I research project is to validate the feasibility of achieving a high energy product nanostructured permanent magnet powder by coating commercially available samarium cobalt particles with nanometer-scale shells of iron or cobalt. Nanostructured permanent magnet powders, comprised of micron-size hard magnetic core particles surrounded by nanometer-scale soft magnetic shells, show promise as a replacement for high energy product rare earth permanent magnets. Commercial production of these materials, however, has proved problematic due to the difficulty of handling and coating ultrafine powders while maintaining clean core-shell interfaces. In this Phase I project, magnetic nanostructured powders will be fabricated using powder encapsulation technology has been shown to enable the production of nanometer-scale metallic shell layers on micron-sized metallic core particles in an ultra-clean atmosphere controlled environment. Using these powders, proof-of-concept bonded permanent magnets will be manufactured and evaluated for potential use in simple motors that utilize bonded samarium cobalt or neodymium iron boron magnets. High performance magnetic core-shell powders produced with this particle encapsulation technology will demonstrate the possibility of achieving reduced rare-earth-content high energy product permanent magnets and lay the foundation for commercial-scale production of these materials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is two-pronged: removal of metal  contaminants in wastewater to limit regulatory/environmental costs and recovery of economically valuable metals. Water metal contamination is a ubiquitous problem due to the many industrialized processes that drive our economy. Examples include mining drainage, metal plating, semiconductor fabrication, and solar cell production. These examples straddle well-established and emerging industries but each pose significant environmental impact due to metal contamination potential. Furthermore, the loss of the associated metals carries an economic consequence as un-recovered material represents a significant missed opportunity in raw material utilization. The proposed technology in this Phase I project is poised to address these concerns.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to produce a novel metal binding compound and to scale-up the water-metal removal prototypes based upon this compound. The project will develop a production system for producing a small molecule natural product capable of binding metal compounds with high affinity. This compound will be bound to a solid matrix which enables a heterogeneous means of removing metal content from contaminated water samples. Existing small-scale production and water treatment prototypes will be subjected to cellular and process engineering to scale up for water treatment applications. This scaling step is considered crucial to establishing the viability of the overall technology and approach. Metabolic engineering strategies will be utilized to improve cellular production of the metal binding compound. Process engineering will be applied to scale production of the compound and to assess subsequent packed-bed column operations designed to continuously remove metals from water samples. The team will work closely with a local metal plating company to demonstrate the technology with field wastewater samples. Success will result in a scaled prototype for extended application across industries facing metal contamination/loss.

    (diatoms) and sunlight without the use of hazardous chemicals or non-renewable
    energy to remove contaminants such as silica, calcium, iron, manganese, phosphorus
    and nitrogen from the concentrated waste streams (brines) from advanced water
    reclamation and brackish groundwater desalination facilities.  Additional clean,

    improve the efficiency of water treatment.  This Phase I project will have broader
    impacts on the advancement of science and technology related to environmental
    microbiology, water reuse and water resource management.  The experimental data

    such as executive functioning and reasoning, shown to be critical for school success.
    The first aim is to build a prototype of a game-based assessment tool for these
    skills that can be implemented in classrooms to measure these skills as a baseline
    and to track and measure progress over time. If proven feasible, the prototype
    is expected to assess a child's skills in five neuro-cognitive areas in 10-15
    minutes with minimal adult intervention and provide recommendations for further
    support. Phase I of this project will focus on developing the prototype, testing
    usability and feasibility with Pre-K students and teachers, and collecting data
    to calibrate the tool using factor analysis and item-response theory. The broader
    impact of this research is to gather rich data that will advance the scientific

    and to increase the ability to evaluate the impact of targeted interventions.
    In addition, commercialization of the proposed tool will help increase teachers'

    Next, the prototype will undergo usability and feasibility testing with Pre-K
    students and teachers. The goal is to optimize the experience such that it can
    be completed in a single 15-minute session with minimal adult intervention. Finally,
    data will be gathered to calibrate the tool using factor analysis and item-response

    This SBIR Phase I project is proposing the development of a new electrochemical method for the manufacture of chemicals of interest to pharmaceutical, agricultural and fine chemical producers. New chemical manufacturing technologies are needed to reduce the environmental costs and the risk posed by traditional chemical manufacturing technologies. Flow technology is reducing the hazard, environmental impact and cost of drug manufacture while at the same time providing an improved product. This project will develop new chemistries designed to operate using flow technology. The development of such new reactions is necessary to realize the full benefit of flow technology. Further, new equipment for the research laboratory is also necessary to speed the development of this advanced manufacturing technology. NSF investment in the development of advance manufacturing technology like this SBIR Phase I project will have widespread impact on the US economy. The technology promises to lower the cost of producing medicines and materials. The point-of-use production of chemicals enabled by this proposal has the potential to eliminate the need to ship, store and handles hazardous materials. The development of advanced chemical manufacturing technologies such as this project will be a strategic advantage to US manufacturers enabling the creation of new high value molecules using the highly efficient technologies such as this project.


    This SBIR Phase I project is aimed at the development of an electrochemically-mediated reaction using flow chemistry as practical, safe and sustainable means of replacing hazardous and environmentally damaging catalysts and reagents in the manufacture of high-value chemicals and materials. Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions are of critical importance to the commercial production of medicines and materials. These reactions typically use of highly reactive organometallic reactants in combination with precious metal catalysis to form the bond. This SBIR project is aimed at developing an electrochemical sp2-sp3 bond forming reaction. The project will use the Kolbe electrolysis reaction to generate sp3 radicals which will react with an aryl or vinyl halide in the presence of a nickel catalyst used to activate a sp2-halide bond. Electricity will be used to both oxidize the carboxylates and reduce the nickel catalyst in an electrochemical flow-cell. Developed as a flow process, this method will be readily applicable to commercial scale production. To facilitate development of the reaction the project will also develop an optimal lab-scale electrochemical flow cell. The project goal is to both develop both a more efficient method for sp2-sp3 bond forming and also develop appropriate lab tools to enable other researchers to easily adopt and use the new reaction types.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance the ability of forensic scientists to capture, analyze, and search fingerprint impression evidence in the field. Additionally, a contactless device will eliminate the potential for alteration, loss of detail, or destruction of the fingerprint impression. This system will also have a positive impact on law enforcement agencies by accelerating fingerprint recovery, improving the quality of fingerprint impression evidence collected at crime scenes, reducing training requirements, and accelerating investigations. Furthermore, this project will address numerous concerns and recommendations regarding fingerprints and forensics published in the National Research Council's (NRC) 2009 Report, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel device capable of digitally acquiring the various types of fingerprint impressions found at crime scenes - latent, patent, and plastic. Fingerprints represent one of the most important and fragile types of evidence. However, manually processing crime scenes for fingerprint impressions requires trained technicians, a variety of supplies, and a significant amount of time. Once visualized and processed, fingerprint impressions must undergo a multitude of steps in order to be digitized for searching against databases of exemplar fingerprint records. The goal of Phase I is to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of utilizing a contactless, three-dimensional (3D) scanning device to acquire different types of fingerprint impressions deposited on a variety of surfaces and convert them into two-dimensional (2D) fingerprints that are consistent and compatible with existing fingerprint databases and matching algorithms. To achieve these goals, the research team will build a prototype 3D scanner, develop new unrolling and segmentation algorithms, and test the ability to match recovered fingerprints against a database of exemplar fingerprint records.

    The broader impacts of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project relate to the increased viability of indigo as an agricultural crop competing with synthetically manufactured indigo dye.  Indigo was among the major global cash crops of the 18th and 19th centuries and accounted for 100% of the indigo dye consumed in the world.  Since the beginning of the 20th century, nearly 100% of the indigo dye consumed in the world has been synthetically manufactured from petroleum derivatives and hazardous and toxic chemicals.  A small amount of plant-derived indigo dye is produced throughout the world using traditional artisan methods largely unchanged for centuries, but this supply is highly variable in purity and consistency and is far from cost competitive with synthetically manufactured indigo dye.  Stony Creek Colors in cooperation with the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center seeks through this project to improve the available indigo planting stock by creating a high-throughput handheld assay device capable of rapid measurements of the chemical precursors for indigo which exist naturally in the plant leaves.  During this process the team will also improve the understanding of the genetics of the existing indigo planting stock through DNA analysis of specific high-yielding plant varieties.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop new tools, both genomic and phenomic, for analyzing the indigo crop Persicaria tinctoria, to produce an improved bio-based specialty chemical derived from renewable, abundant plant-material. The STTR project will map existing genetic resources while developing a unique approach for plant indican (indigo precursor) analysis which will enable non-destructive analysis of plant leaves in breeding lines.  Finally, a genetic mapping population between high and low indican-producing parent plants will be constructed for analysis and laboratory validation.  Successful completion of the Phase I tasks tied to these objectives will prove the feasibility of selecting and maintaining high indigotin yielding strains of P. tinctoria.  These improvements will be commercialized through higher indigotin yielding breeders seed stock and will be spread to over 26,000 acres of cropland in the Southeast US within 6 years, resulting in a more reliable and cost-competitive bio-based indigo dye extracted from U.S. grown plant material.  This will allow plant-derived indigo to be more cost-competitive with synthetic indigo dye and to meet the immediate market demand for U.S. bio-based indigo by denim mills.

    in cereals, fruit, and vegetable crops. The use of chemical fungicides produced
    from fossil fuels has been shown to have adverse environmental effects on non-target

The proposed innovation will help to determine the feasibility of developing, testing, and commercializing innovative technologies that improve the efficacy of existing health IT solutions and to create new solutions for the range of stakeholders exhibiting increasingly high demand for effective interventions and tools required to develop, provide, and assess effective addiction treatment and recovery support services in a mix of research and delivery settings and the ability to generate significant revenue across the mix of public and private addiction recovery delivery settings.

    The proposed project will entail rapidly assembling the technical foundation and then testing the feasibility of supporting deployment and assessment of novel, evidence-based addiction treatment strategies and recovery interventions. There are four key research objectives: (1) design, develop, and test a mechanism to create statistically significant cohorts; (2) discern and test methods to measure participant recovery and sobriety success; (3) conduct internal treatment campaigns; and, (4) create a researcher application program interface to enable addiction researchers to connect with the system. Currently, there is no commercially viable platform for surfacing, implementing, and tracking the efficacy of optimal therapies and tools in an application environment. Phase I will focus on determining the feasibility of this technology for unlocking scientific interventions that can be clinically validated as successful in order to expand work in phase II to prove the capacity of this system to deliver single or bivariate therapy campaigns to users while also establishing the clinical efficacy for improving health outcomes sufficient to support interventions nationwide through cost-effective treatment solutions.

    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing ophthalmic lenses utilizing a low cost optical printer that will enable the fabrication of superior quality lenses with a low cost optical printer.  The result is development of a business model where an eye exam is administered, prescription lenses are printed and glasses assembled and dispensed in a single visit.  Upon completing the refraction portion of the eye exam, the lens prescriptions will be electronically transferred to the optical lens printer.  The lens blanks, pre-treated for UV and anti-scratch protection, will contain a laser writable photopolymer layer that accepts and freezes the personalized prescriptions.  Eyeglasses produced with this method will be of equal or higher in optical quality compared to traditional lenses and can be produced at a fraction of the cost of conventional lenses.  This method of producing ophthalmic lenses both reduces the turnaround time for securing eyeglasses but equally important, will significantly reduce the cost for producing eyeglasses translating to lower the retail prices.   Considering that over 60% of the US population wears glasses and a much high percentage of families have members that depend on glasses, this project will benefit the vast majority of US taxpayers.

    The goal of this STTR Phase 1 proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of three coupled innovations: 1) a high-speed optical printer for 2) photosensitive ophthalmic lens blanks that record 3) novel gradient-index diffractive optics which provide dramatically improved fabrication cost, visual performance and lighter weight over existing lens making technologies.  The target application will be low cost, low and higher order aberration correcting eyeglass lenses fabricated with a compact, inexpensive optical printer.  Lenses produced with this light based process will match or exceed the optical quality of current free form lenses made with computer numerical controlled milling machines costing in the range of $250k to $500k.  This proposed lens making innovation enables the development of an eyeglass dispensing business model that could eliminate the need for conventional centralized eyeglass labs, the associated distribution networks, a comprehensive inventory of lens blanks and the long wait times for procuring prescription eyeglasses.  The developments of this STTR will allow ophthalmic practices to better serve their patients, enabling on-site fabrication of superior corrective lenses that more closely match eye deficiencies.  By the end of phase I, the goal is to optimize the photopolymer materials, refine the light sources and complete an engineering model of the optical printer.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in its potential to develop a new mechanism
    for painlessly terminating atrial fibrillation.  Cardiac arrhythmia is one of
    the leading causes of death and debilitation.  A common means of terminating harmful
    rhythms is delivering a shock via an external or implantable defibrillator.  The
    pain from the shock is the number one concern for patients with implantable defibrillators,
    and because of the pain, an implantable option is not practical for atrial fibrillation.
    \ The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will
    significantly advance the field of defibrillation therapy and aims to lead to
    the introduction of a new class of implantable medical device technology. \n\nThe
    proposed project seeks to develop and evaluate an implantable device that achieves
    non-destructive temporary conduction delay in cardiac tissues for the painless
    termination, and potentially prevention, of life threatening arrhythmias.  Cardiac
    arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed
    world. More than 1,000 Americans die each day from sudden cardiac arrest.  The
    project intends to initially target the development of a device to achieve rapid
    and painless termination of life threatening arrhythmias to treat atrial fibrillation.
    The successful development of the proposed device has the potential to benefit
    millions of patients.  Additionally, by virtue of its painless modulation of arrhythmogenesis,
    the proposed device may well also terminate incipient arrhythmias.  The phase
    I project will develop instrumentation, conduct experiments and develop a cardiac
    model and simulation environment to validate the technique in support of the development
    of a prototype system.  The determination of a dose response characteristic of
    the proposed therapy in this phase of the research is an expected long-term outcome
    of the project."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project is the development of a process for the sustainable production of high value chemicals (HVCs) from non-food biomass. The resulting HVCs, isoeugenol and ferulate, are the starting materials used in the flavor and fragrance industry for the manufacture of natural vanillin. Today, only a small percentage of the 18,000 metric tons of vanillin used annually is produced from natural sources. The clear majority of vanillin is produced by harsh chemical derivatization of petroleum feedstock. Using the innovative technology developed by Spero Energy, Inc., non-food biomass can be used to produce the starting materials for natural vanillin production. Sustainable manufacturing of natural isoeugenol and ferulate from non-food biomass will serve to advance the US bioeconomy while supplying essential starting materials to the $600 million a year and growing vanillin industry.

    The technical objectives of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project are to demonstrate the scalability of Spero?s technology for production of natural isoeugenol and ferulate from non-food biomass. Increasing consumer demand for products containing natural flavors and fragrances, and the associated premium prices relative to artificial alternatives, offers a promising venue to advance the US bioeconomy. Spero Energy, Inc. has developed natural and sustainable methods to produce isoeugenol and ferulate, key starting materials for the synthesis of natural vanillin. Vanillin is one of the most widely utilized flavors with a market value of over $600 million per year. Key research objectives include scaling production volumes of ferulate and isoeugenol, followed by a detailed study of purification methods, biochemical conversion to natural vanillin, and validation of the organoleptic properties of the resulting vanillin. This work is anticipated to yield key reaction and purification data which will be analyzed with ASPEN modeling in preparation for pilot scale production in Phase II.

    This SBIR Phase I project is to develop and demonstrate novel nanotechnology based flow battery that meets demanding 2020 energy density targets for transportation and stationary storage and offers a cheaper, safer and environmentally friendly rechargeable energy-storing fluid, which could ultimately allow using batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) in the same fashion as gasoline-powered engines. The proposed innovative approach uses advancements in nanotechnology to merge solid battery chemistries into a convenient flowable format (nanoelectrofuels or NEF). The low cost and high energy density of the proposed flow batteries (up to 350 Wh/L) makes this technology highly competitive with currently used Li-ion batteries (250 Wh/L), while the flowable format enables charging the liquid in one device and use of energy in a separate device, offering new refueling opportunities for EV operations, specifically addressing range anxiety and long charging time - issues currently preventing widespread adoption of EVs. From the commercial perspective the successful development of the proposed low cost high energy density aqueous flow battery could be transformational for electrification of personal and commercial transportation, grid leveling, and integration of renewable energy sources into our individual energy usage for a climate-friendly, environmentally and economically sustainable future.


    In this project novel low-cost, high energy density rechargeable liquids that feature active energy storing materials in pumpable low viscosity aqueous nanosuspension (NEF) will be demonstrated in a full flow cell reactor (Phase I). The challenge of achieving electroactive suspensions with high solid loading and low viscosity is addressed by changing the surface chemistry of nanoparticles and based on the patented surface modification approach which enables high dispersibility of nanoparticles in fluids and their ability to more efficiently transport and store electrical energy. Innovation in flow cell designs are also proposed for effective battery operations with this new energy storage format. Demonstration of this technology in a full flow cell will significantly de-risk further commercialization efforts for this transformational technology and will enable highly versatile, interchangeable and rechargeable liquids for electrical energy storage solutions. The main outcome of this project (Phase II) will be the prototype of NEF flow battery with design geared towards the first market - light electric utility vehicles (EUVs, $1.3 B market in US) that currently use Pb-acid batteries. For the same volume and 25% lower price per kWh the NEF battery offers ~3 times the energy storage and the additional ability of rapid charge replenishment through active material (NEF) replacement.

    fabrication of X-ray focusing devices for high photon energies in the range from
    10 keV to >100 keV, necessary for imaging, microtomography, and elemental and
    structural analyses of materials in spectral ranges and at resolutions unavailable
    today. Their primary use is in high-end synchrotron radiation facilities and in
    X-ray microscopes with X-ray tubes sources in specialized industrial and research
    environments. They form a special class of high-value consumables, with a functional
    life time of ~2.5 years, with capabilities to address the global market segment
    worth about $1M today for low and average performance diffractive focusing devices,
    to more than $4M, if the unprecedented performance devices will be developed.
    Availability of such focusing devices will enhance the scientific understanding
    of structure of matter at the nano-scale and the interplay of structure and functionality
    for applications ranging from drugs development to materials science, nano-electronics,
    biosciences, forensics, battery and energy research, investigating terrestrial
    soils or cosmic dust, the kinetics of ultra-fast chemical reactions, advanced
    catalysts, and others. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is twofold.
    First, the innovative method of fabrication is a combination of top-down and bottom-up
    processing. It includes the atomic layer deposition onto batch-fabricated cylindrical
    silicon precursors of sequences of low and high absorption and refractive index
    materials, with well-controlled layer thicknesses varying from few nm to micrometers
    according to the Fresnel zone rules, followed by polishing the wafer to form membranes
    with focusing devices embedded into them. Hundreds of zone plates can be produced
    on one wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second, the method is
    extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material layers, which
    enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index kinoforms ? devices with single
    foci and of ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I will address these issues
    by effectively assessing the capabilities for individual key processes and will
    prove the fabrication feasibility, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication
    and testing of prototypes with long runs of atomic layer deposition processes,
    as necessary for functional devices."

    This Phase I SBIR project is directed at developing  a portable, sensitive, and affordable device to detect M. tuberculosis (Mtb) in sputum samples and simultaneously determine the multidrug resistance profile of the pathogen, all within 3 days of sputum collection (It takes more than 6 weeks using current technology).   By significantly reducing the time to detect viable Mtb and obtain its drug resistance profile in patient specimens, the device being developed promises to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public-health challenges in the world today, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2013. More alarmingly, the incidence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB is rapidly increasing, especially in low resource environments.  Being able to detect the presence of low loads of mycobacteria and gaining knowledge about the drug resistance profile of a particular isolate in 3 days will be a game changer in global community?s efforts to combat the spread of TB (esp. MDR TB). It will lead to better outcomes for patients (less mortality, quicker recovery), and also better public health (less transmission to others and less fostering of drug resistance in populations).

    The device being developed incorporates two key technologies that enable it to achieve rapid detection and drug-resistance profiling: (1) super-paramagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) functionalized with moieties that bind to bacterial cells, and (2) microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) that is able to detect in real time the growth or death of cells in suspension.  The proposed approach involves (a) using MNPs to collect the ~1000 Mtb cells present in 2-10ml of sputum sample into a small (200ul) of growth medium during the standard decontamination process (b) dispensing the 200ul suspension into 16 microwells, each containing different formulations of freeze-dried growth-media and/or drugs of interest (c) monitoring the cells in each well m-EIS.  The pre-concentration will take <1 hour, and the monitoring of death/growth/stasis will take 3 days. In Phase I, the team will (1) verify the efficacy of the pre-concentration technique,  (2) establish the ability of the m-EIS method to record in real time the death, proliferation, or statis of mycobacteria, and (3) design a prototype cassette containing 16 wells, and fabricating it using 3D-printing (stereolithography).  In addition, a detailed design (electrical, mechanical and fluidic) of the automated system (disposables and nondisposable hardware) to be built in Phase II will be completed, and other applications of the core approach explored.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the ability of this technology to impact how every battery is made, tested, managed, and re-used in the near future. Batteries are ubiquitous, and their use is likely to increase in the future. As such, there is a growing need for low-cost, accurate methods for monitoring the state of charge (SOC) and the state of health (SOH) in real time to optimize performance and maximize lifetime. The technology that will be developed in this project will use ultrasound to noninvasively probe batteries and provide physical insights into SOC and SOH, and will work on any closed battery regardless of chemistry and form factor. Initial finding of this hypothesis have already been demonstrated and published. This is an unexplored area and presents a large commercial opportunity in each sector of the battery industry, including diagnostics, quality assurance, active cycling control, and the emerging second-life markets. Several advantages include sensitivity to subtle physical changes within cells, the ability to probe lab and commercial scale cells, and sub-millisecond readings. From battery R&D, to manufacturing, to management systems, ultrasound for batteries will help enable the efficient generation, storage, and use of energy worldwide.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support the development of this technology leading to the first commercial ultrasonic battery analysis unit. The feasibility of 1) miniaturized pulser-receivers with pulsing and switching speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than commercial units, and 2) miniaturized transducers that can transmit and receive high quality signals will be demonstrated. This would enable the detection of high-rate phenomena and the use of multiplexed systems. 3) The use of fast data analysis algorithms for real-time SOC prediction using acoustics as the main input will also be addressed. These objectives are necessary for demonstrating the applicability of ultrasonic analysis to the battery R&D, manufacturing, and second life markets. The success of Phase I of this project will lead to the development of micron-scale sensors for incorporation in battery management systems. In Phase II, algorithms for SOH prediction and cycling control based on acoustic data will be developed, as well as investigation of the design and fabrication of microelectronic transducers will be performed.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to significantly improve the patient experience by providing easy, convenient, and fast delivery of protein therapeutics through the administration of high-concentration, low-viscosity solutions via subcutaneous injection. Currently, high-concentration antibody solutions have viscosities far above the recommended limit for subcutaneous injections. This project aims to drastically lower the viscosities of high-concentration protein formulations. The success of this project would greatly benefit patients by providing a much shorter administration time for drugs that now require hours of intravenous infusion. In addition, this solution can also improve therapies that are already administered subcutaneously by reducing the frequency of injections by increasing dosage. Development of this technology can also enable the development of protein therapeutics with promising efficacy, but intractable solution properties or commercially unattractive patent lives.

    The goal of this Phase I project is to establish the proof-of-concept data supporting the viability of a new formulation platform for proteins. This platform will generate a formulation containing high concentrations of protein therapeutics which may be delivered at substantially lowered viscosities due to a reduction in the intermolecular interactions among proteins. The formulation thus provides a subcutaneous syringe-compatible route to delivering biologics at high-concentration, and low-viscosity, ultimately driving a shift from timely intravenous delivery protocols to simplified subcutaneous injections. Constraints on subcutaneous delivery volume (<2 mL) necessitate antibody concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL. Unfortunately, viscosities far beyond the accepted injection limit (50 cP) are typical of this situation due to extensive interaction among the protein molecules. Current viscosity reduction methods attempt to regulate these interactions but have yet to substantially address the issue. The proposed work utilizes a novel process to gently formulate proteins using only FDA-approved materials. This approach eliminates the effect of the protein-protein interactions on the solution viscosity. The proposed project will involve development of the platform through (i) identification of optimal formulation parameters, (ii) demonstration of rheological improvements to high-concentration protein solutions, and (iii) demonstration of preservation of biological structure and activity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of an inexpensive way to create projected displays on arbitrary surfaces. This can have a tremendous impact in the ease of deployment and maintenance of low cost high-resolution displays on existing common surfaces (e.g. walls, pillars, objects, whiteboards) as well as prototyped (3D printed, clay, or Lego) models. This opportunity can dove-tail well with the maker-movement that democratizes manufacturing, artistic creation, and design. All of the benefits of the maker movement for society, the economy, commerce, and education will multiply with the introduction of an inexpensive and easy to use technology for creating displays on arbitrary surfaces. New markets that are constrained due to the cost of current solutions will open up for adopting this low-cost technology. Such markets include elementary schools in need of collaborative interactive devices, mobile planetariums, inflatable temporary display structures for independent artists, and others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a completely automated solution to create seamless imagery using multiple projectors on an arbitrarily shaped surface. Additionally, the project aims to enable multi-user interaction with this multi-projector display on an arbitrarily shaped surface. The company is proposing to develop software that uses a distributed network of computers, projectors, and cameras to respectively drive, project, and observe the projected light on the display in order to automatically compute (a) the position, orientation, and color parameters of the cameras and projectors, and (b) the shape of the display surface. This automated process will operate by the push of a button and take a few seconds to minutes depending on the complexity of the geometry of the display surface. Using this computed information the system will (i) perform real-time image correction to register multiple projected images and thereby create a seamless display that looks as though it is being projected from a single projector; and (b) handle interactions of multiple users with the display appropriately.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a non-invasive imaging technology to help save the vision of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision loss in the US and worldwide. The American Diabetes Association estimates that DR causes $98 billion in lost productivity and medical expenses annually. DR is a complication of both type I and II diabetes and results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Recent studies have demonstrated that small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation are a reliable indicator of pre-stage and early-stage DR -- before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of achieving such a high resolution, a major need exists for the development of advanced retinal oximetry technologies with demonstrated clinical utility. This project aims to meet this major need based on a novel approach to functional imaging, thereby improving the lives of U.S. citizens and reducing the devastating economic impact of DR. By mitigating its occurrence, the technology developed as a result of this project will help reduce the cost of DR treatment and its overall economic burden.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops a non-invasive imaging technology to provide high-resolution retinal oxygen saturation maps of diabetic patients in one snapshot. There are no existing commercial technologies with these capabilities; the proposed technology is a first-of-its-kind effort. Compared with existing methods, the successful outcome of this project can become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. This non-invasive, instantaneous and easy-to-use biophotonics technology will aid in both the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetic retinopathy. This project's scope includes three parts. First, bench-scale studies will validate the innovative, physics-based concept and algorithm proposed as the basis of the technology. Second, a prototype will be developed and tested. Finally, the technology prototype will be validated in a clinical setting to establish the utility and effectiveness of the technology in an actual operating environment.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is three-fold. First, accurate motion tracking
    is an open research problem, and the proposed approaches have the potential to
    significantly advance state-of-the-art in localization and tracking and facilitate
    new innovations. Second, there is the potential for significant commercial impacts.
    The project aims to introduce a disruptive technology in motion tracking to benefit
    a broad customer base. If successful, it can accelerate development of companies
    whose products benefit from motion tracking.  Third, motion tracking has many

    This SBIR Phase II project deals with the development of a gamified educational platform meant to excite and inspire children to learn about the sciences through the medium of cooking. By engaging students with interactive content in K-8 classrooms, after school programs, and special education settings, the proposed innovation aims to simultaneously accomplish three outcomes that are important to K-8 students' education and healthy living. These outcomes include: (1) helping students develop a highly practical skill (cooking), (2) generating excitement about and enhancing learning in several scientific disciplines (particularly nutrition science, STEM, and human geography), and (3) promoting a highly desirable behavior in students (the development of healthy eating habits). This project proposes to develop a prototype version of the innovative educational technology. It builds upon an existing proof-of-concept application that integrates nutrition science (in the form of cooking recipes) with human geography (different countries and cultures) and significantly enhances this application by innovatively linking the cooking-related content to a STEM curriculum and testing the addition of a variety of capabilities meant to increase user engagement and learning through the application. This Phase I proposal will research the feasibility and usability of the product, and investigate the extent to which the proposed technology is able to simultaneously achieve the three stated outcomes in a way that outperforms traditional paper-based school curricula. With the market for mobile learning products valued at $12.2 billion, the company's three-pronged approach to improving learning and health-related outcomes for K-8 students stands to generate significant revenue. The team estimates that the business can reach roughly 2 million in sales in the first three years following the product?s launch.

    The proposed research will explore (1) various ways for the system to automatically link cooking concepts with STEM concepts in a way that enhances learning and engagement and produces a curriculum compliant with Next Generation Science Standards, (2) the application of emotional intelligence to data gathered, such that the technology will track students? mood and food choices, and provide suggestions based on an optimal match between the two, and (3) the use of adaptive learning to effectively deliver the above curriculum in a targeted and personalized manner (including accommodations for children with special needs during Phase II). These outcomes will be achieved by creating and testing new capabilities for the system, including the ability to monitor user performance, a points-based progression system, personalization, customized STEM games, and matching students with recipes and lesson plans based on their culinary preferences and emotional moods, the majority of which will be implemented via the use of machine learning. Overall, the goal of the small business is to develop several different app features that incorporate the above-mentioned approaches, and to determine, through repeated and rigorous classroom testing with K-8 students, which combination of features maximizes the learning and behavioral outcomes that the application is targeting.

    This SBIR Phase I project provides student access to computer science curriculum and computational thinking skills to better prepare for college and the workforce. Unfortunately, no organized computer science curriculum is offered in majority of schools in the United States and only 1 out of 4 public high schools in the United States offer even one computer science class.  Educators and administrators need new platforms of community and technical support to overcome these modern challenges and accomplish these critical goals. This project is aimed at the design and development of a web-based software platform to enable educators to confidently teach computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education in classrooms and community centers. The resulting software platform would enable rapid growth of after-school clubs, camps, evening classes, in-school field trips, workshops, and educational gaming. This effort further democratizes the teaching of computer science and engineering concepts, thus addressing the talent gap that is leaving the United States behind in cybersecurity and in the world economy. This project has significant revenue and growth potential as it can be of service to approximately 3 million public school teachers and 50.1 million students who attended public elementary and secondary schools in 2015.

    This project will design and develop a web-based software platform to easily connect, attract, and foster the exchange, co-creation, and delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. Analytics and metrics will be applied and developed to gain insight into the support needed for effective instruction. Instructors will be able to develop rich, dynamic, and engaging content, allowing secondary and elementary students to actively participate with the material and to assess their understanding. Students using the platform will also get access to expert mentors for debugging help, code review, and to ask questions. Educators will able to communicate best practices to ensure continuous access to high quality computer literacy resources. As a result, the platform provides superior pedagogy for secondary and elementary school students learning computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity.  An initial alpha launch, a pilot study and analytical data gathering will be conducted throughout Phase 1 to study the efficacy of the proposed solution. The goal of this research is to verify the system features, the ease of use and to understand if Phase 1 activities result in a prototype that offers technical feasibility to solve the problem.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to understand how conductivity in the brain is affected by anatomical variability between patients and, more importantly, to enable precise treatment of neurological diseases using transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) techniques. A number of studies have shown these techniques may be used, cost-effectively, to improve learning, working memory, as well as relieve chronic pain and the symptoms of depression, fibromyalgia, Parkinson's, and schizophrenia. However, current understanding of electromagnetic (EM) characteristics for the human head and state-of-the-art TMS and tDCS techniques suffer from the inability to precisely control the most appropriate excitation pathways in the brain to support a specified clinical objective. This can result in unexpected and sometimes ineffective or even detrimental outcomes. Models and TMS/tDCS treatment systems for implementation of excitation techniques are not validated to standards.  A thorough understanding of pathways and development of validated mimics and phantom structures will enable development and clinical implementation of precisely controlled analytical models and protocols for effective, widely accessible, reliable and safe TMS/tDCS treatments.

    The proposed project will address gaps in current knowledge of intracranial electromagnetic characteristics and materials performance to develop reproducible head phantoms for clinical implementation of more precise, quantifiable tDCS and TMS techniques. This research will characterize solid, liquid and gel materials selected to comply with biomedical and commercialization criteria. Analyses will be used to develop formulations of combinations of materials that address the range of conductivity and anisotropy of the parts and interfaces of the human brain. These formulations will be experimentally evaluated and refined for producibility and accuracy.  This will provide a database of materials solutions which will be used in Phase II and beyond.  Traditional brain conductivity mimics are simple spherical shells consisting of a single agar based conductivity mimic, which lacks the complexity of the human brain. The challenges of developing an EM brain phantom include fabrication of the various materials for controlled and reproducible anisotropic conductivity values, shaping these materials to mimic anatomical features, and combining them to represent boundary interfaces and control gaps for accurate pathway performance. The proposed effort includes development of a shell mimic that incorporates applicable material formulations to validate extensibility to more sophisticated prototype phantoms during Phase II.

    This SBIR Phase I project tackles the key challenges of using screen-printing to manufacture receive coils for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at a commercial scale. MRI is widely used to establish a broad variety of clinical diagnosis, but suffers from long exam times and a high rate of failure, resulting in high costs. Printed receive coils are flexible, lightweight, conform well to the human body and can be manufactured at an order of magnitude lower costs. With this technology, coils can be designed and printed to fit all patient anatomy, therefore improving image quality and offering superior comfort. These technology offers the potential to increase success rate of MRI exams, speed up procedure time and to enhance clinical workflow. Printed coils will have an impact on the accessibility to MRI, serving a more diverse patient population, such as pediatric and bariatric patients, who currently have limited access to this imaging modality, due to the lack of adequate coils. Overall, this project aims at enabling the fabrication of printed coils, thus contributing to reduce health care costs associated with MRI while significantly improving the quality of patient care.


    This SBIR Phase I project investigates critical aspects of characterization of screen-printing MRI coil arrays for clinical use. We have shown that printed and flexible MRI arrays provide diagnostic images, while providing better fit and comfort to patients.  Printing electronic materials is a novel manufacturing approach which is used here to fabricate these medical devices.  Our goal is to provide coils with size and design customized for the diverse anatomy of patients. In this proposed program, we will evaluate the reproducibility of printing, design strategies and the robustness and lifetime of printed coil arrays. Coil size and geometry have a direct impact on image quality and body coverage. We will study the fundamental limits of coil size and geometry when fabricated using solution processed conductors with lower conductivity than conventional metals. The variations in measured signal-to-noise-ratio and image quality from print to print will be characterized and documented in order to provide a successful model for large-scale and low-cost manufacturing of coil arrays. Finally, the robustness of printed arrays will be tested. The packaging used in our designs are significantly different from the status-quo. Lifetime quantification for arrays used in clinical scenarios is important for a successful business plan.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to remove organic pollutants using newly developed adsorbent materials derived from cyclodextrins. The chemical contamination of water resources due to agricultural, industrial, and human activities is known to have adverse effects on the environment, especially aquatic ecosystems, and human health. Currently utilized adsorbents, particularly activated carbons, typically have limitations in removing micropollutants effectively at environmentally relevant concentrations, ranging from parts per trillion (ppt) to parts per billion (ppb). This project will focus on the fundamental development and manufacture of polymer adsorbents from building blocks derived from corn starch that rapidly sequester many pollutants more effectively than activated carbons. These polymers exhibit tiny pores and high surface areas, and are structurally programmable to target specific contaminants and separation challenges. Current water filtration systems found in homes, hospitals, industrial settings, and municipal wastewater treatment sites will benefit from these activities.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a sustainable materials solution to address the problem of emerging organic contaminants in water. Promising materials are derived from a cyclodextrin monomer and a crosslinker, which react to provide a rigid porous network. Materials derived from this approach remove contaminants from water more effectively than leading adsorbents, such as activated carbons. Previously, initial polymers were prepared at laboratory scales in relatively low yields. The objective of this proposal is to develop polymerization conditions that provide high yields and are amenable to large-scale manufacturing processes, while maintaining the pollutant removal performance of the polymer. This objective will require a systematic study of reaction conditions to minimize side reactions and maximize polymerization efficiency. Structural characterization using various spectroscopies and porosimetry will be used to evaluate the polymerization process as a function of the reaction conditions. The polymer's ability to bind pollutants will also ensure that improved yields still maintain performance. Determining the optimal polymerization conditions and processing protocols will be critical for validating the technical feasibility of the proposed porous cyclodextrin polymer and will also be criteria for the success of this SBIR Phase I project.

    This SBIR Phase I project will focus on a novel medical ultrasound device for the accurate diagnosis of middle ear infections. The device uses a small transducer that transmits ultrasound energy into the ear canal to determine whether a middle ear infection is present, and whether an antibiotic is appropriate. The focus will be to design and optimize an air-coupled MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) ultrasound transducer. The device will be a cost-effective method to improve diagnoses and reduce antibiotics in a market in which 17.6M doctor visits per year are coded directly to middle ear infections in the U.S. Ear infections are the #1 indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children and the #1 cause for surgery in childhood, costing more than $10B annually in the U.S. Accessing this market will require consistent device performance with low variability and rare failure, as well as the ability to perform manufacturing with a high yield.

    This SBIR Phase I project will seek to enable the development of the first known commercial medical product utilizing air-coupled (capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducer) CMUT technology. CMUTs have been proposed for many applications, but very few have moved beyond the early research stage due to the high degree of technical difficulty and cost required to translate a research device into one that generates consistent transducer performance with low variability and rare failure rate. The work of this proposal facilitates the investigators? goal by establishing fast automated assessment of CMUT performance, both electrically and mechanically. The investigators will design and construct test systems to rapidly and automatically evaluate electromechanical and acoustical performance of CMUT designs. The electromechanical system automatically evaluates electrical impedance across frequency and bias voltage. The acoustical test system automatically evaluates pulse-echo directivity and sensitivity of a given CMUT, across bias voltage and pulsing parameters. The authors propose to use the two test systems to determine electromechanical tests which can be done in the foundry at the wafer level, which are predictive of acoustic performance. NSF funding is being sought to make this challenging but promising CMUT technology a commercial reality.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a superior alternative to the current frontline treatment for children?s Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The primary treatment option has a host of negative side effects resulting from the use of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) conjugated to the L-asparaginase enzyme. Antibodies made against this drug can cause the body to eliminate it rapidly or result in a severe allergic reaction and even death, particularly after multiple injections (induced immunity). PEG has been utilized extensively in the food, cosmetics and agricultural industries. As a result, the majority of healthy people test positive for anti-PEG antibodies (pre-existing immunity), causing the elimination of PEG-modified drugs before their action. The technology proposed here utilizes the non-essential amino acid, glycine betaine, to construct a new poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB) polymer for conjugation that is not recognized as a foreign molecule by the immune system. Therefore, it will maintain function and mitigate the negative side effects associated with the immune system that are attributed to the current therapy. Additionally, therapy with PCB conjugates avoids pre-existing immunity to PEG and ensures treatment efficacy. The primary goal of this work is to show that the technology is superior to and safer than the current PEG technology.

    The technical innovation at the foundation of this work is the zwitterionic, poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB) polymer and its use as a bio-conjugate to replace the widely used poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) for the treatment of children?s Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The unique properties of the zwitterionic polymer impart remarkable characteristics to the bio-conjugate that truly eliminates immunogenicity. The current frontline treatment suffers from Accelerated Blood Clearance (ABC) in patients, which has been attributed to induced or pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies. This Phase I project aims to demonstrate that PCB is a preferable bio-conjugation polymer to PEG for the modification of L-asparaginase with regard to extended half-life and decreased immunogenicity after multiple doses in mice. To achieve the goals, an optimized PCB L-asparaginase will be developed with regard to polymer length and conjugation density and a multi-dose pharmacokinetic/immunogenicity study will be performed to evaluate its half-life and immune protection in animals. All results will be compared with those from its PEG counterpart. It is expected that PCB L-asparaginase has great potential to eradicate the serious side effects associated with the current therapy. If PCB L-asparaginase proves to be safe and effective, this will lead to more successful outcomes for the treatment of ALL.

    This SBIR Phase I project will create a novel set of materials for additive manufacturing technologies.  Additive manufacturing, or 3D Printing, is a rapidly growing $5bn industry, which enables small and medium enterprises to competitively manufacture new and innovative products.  It is a key to strengthening the US manufacturing economy.  Continued growth and health of the 3D printing industry, particularly for manufacture of functional parts for finished goods, will depend upon an expansion of the available material library.  3D printing materials are limited to a small segment of the plastics in common industrial use today.  This project will expand that material library with development of printable polyurethane elastomers with a broad range of flexibilities.  These materials will be particularly relevant for markets that demand personalization and customization, such as patient-specific medical devices, sporting goods, and footwear.  Manufacturers of flexible, durable polyurethane goods for industrial and automotive products will also benefit from low cost small-scale production of parts made from materials with performance that match their product specifications.  The printing system will enable production of parts with user-specified geometry and flexibility, and will also enable multi-material printing for novel product designs.


    This SBIR Phase I project will produce a set of reactive polyurethane precursor formulas which can be combined to form printable, flexible polyurethanes with a broad hardness range.  The materials will be printed using extrusion 3D printing techniques, and customized to handle liquid, reactive feeds.  The research approach will include determination of the starting materials to control reaction rates, rheology development, and part solidification.  Reaction kinetics control will be critical to develop a robust printing process and to overcome issues with print-direction strength that are common in extrusion printing processes. Raw material reactivity, catalyst selection, and relative concentrations of formulation components will be key experimental parameters.  Accessing a range of flexibility will require building formulas with varied molecular weights, and these formula variations will be balanced with resin printability.   This 3D printing technology will overcome challenges in part durability and printing speeds that are common to photo-cure approaches to produce flexible parts, and will greatly extend the part durability and flexibility available to extrusion 3D printing.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project appears in three areas.  First, there is an $8B
    dollar market for legacy hardware network security products today that is in transition
    to Software Defined Security. Adoption of this general SDSec platform has the
    potential to accelerate that market transition and improve enterprise security.
    \ Second, this project's success as an open platform could dramatically shorten
    the time between research insight and at-scale production deployments; security
    software built to a lower bar of scale/resiliency is faster and easier to build.
    The end result will be an increased rate of innovation, and new markets for niche,
    fit-for-purpose security functions that today are not profitable for vendors to
    build.  Last, this platform could harmonize enterprise security investments and
    practices for on premise workloads with security investments for public cloud
    workloads, solving a key dilemma faced by leading IT organizations. This will
    make those organizations more competitive on the world stage.\n \nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the two hardest technical
    challenges in building an enterprise-grade network security function, scale and
    resiliency, in a general way that can be applied to both new products and legacy
    codebases with no code change. Addressing scale/resiliency problems in a general
    way across many network security functions is novel, and this particular approach
    of massively parallel, lightweight packet processing functions to achieve this
    is new to this domain.  Why now? The massively parallel design proposed here is
    far too expensive and impractical with traditional hardware-based network functions.
    Even traditional hypervisor-based virtual machines carry too much hardware overhead
    to make this design cost competitive. By using vSwitches and network security
    functions packaged as Linux containers, the hardware overhead cost per instance
    drops dramatically, and this class of approach for scale/resiliency may be proven
    practical."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project may be characterized by major advances in analysis of injection-molded parts, providing notable societal benefits through innovative new uses of these materials.  Of particular note in this regard is the automotive industry.  Despite the long held promise of composite materials in automotive applications, the industry has been slow to adopt widespread use of composites due to uncertainties in performance under challenging loading conditions. A successful rollout of the envisioned software will bring transformational change to this industry, leading to notable long-term societal benefits related to energy efficiency and safety.  Beyond the automotive industry, chopped fiber structural components are ubiquitous in consumer products, aerospace components, and electronics.  The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.  The result is a disruptive technology that will dramatically lower the cost of production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the immense technical challenge associated with nonlinear material modeling to failure of structural components made using chopped fiber composite materials.  The fiber volume fractions and orientations of a chopped fiber composite material produce wild microstructural configurations that may vary throughout the structure.  The problem is significantly amplified by the complex deformation mechanisms occurring in typical polymer matrix materials.  Moreover, polymer behavior is dramatically influenced by environmental and loading conditions.  Existing software solutions for the engineering analysis of chopped fiber structural components are either inadequate due to gross oversimplifications or, at the other extreme, overly complex to implement, thereby rendering them useless to the typical design engineer.  Lack of an adequate software solution results in expensive over-design and dramatically longer cycles to market. The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.   A hallmark of the company's software is an emphasis on simplicity while still producing high fidelity stress analyses simulating complex nonlinear material behaviors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require more modeling to be codified and bring more stakeholders into the fold. Organizations need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that are capable of handling this wider range of data, are fully accessible to non-technical users, and allow more stakeholders to participate in this important process.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. On one end, spreadsheets serve as a general-purpose, ad hoc modeling tool that is open-ended and accessible for many, and on the other, whole software applications whether packaged or custom developed are generally more powerful in important ways but usually sacrifice accessibility and generalizability. This project will produce a prototype of a collaborative integrated development environment for modeling that manages code and data. The technical feasibility of this prototype will be evaluated by developing a test framework that simulates the divergence and convergence of models and scores the outcomes. The commercial feasibility will be evaluated by testing with users building real models to understand the scope of functionality required to bring this to market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide robust, automated security protections to enterprise web applications. With the growing threat of attacks at the web application layer, security is a top of mind concern for both the developers and users of web applications. At the same time, defending against these attacks is a resource-intensive, error-prone process that typically is performed manually by specialized web security experts. The project will use application-aware analysis and an innovative information model to automatically build and deploy web security policies on enterprise servers, freeing the enterprise to focus on their core business and reduce the overhead of internal security teams. The project will also use a hybrid static/dynamic analysis to automatically craft server-side and client-side policies using modern web protection mechanisms to give users of web applications confidence that their interactions with a web application will be secure. This approach leverages cutting-edge techniques from program analysis and machine learning, and will advance the state of the art in automated security policy generation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore ways in which automated security policies enact meaningful protection of sensitive resources. Protecting web applications is a challenging research problem in that automated approaches are either biased towards significant false positive rates, in which benign behavior is flagged as malicious, or significant false negative rates, in which malicious activity is not detected. This project aims to resolve this bias using application aware whitelists: the project automatically explores an application's behavior dynamically, and will also statically build a model of that application's purpose. The project is expected to yield two major components: a server-side protection module to isolate and harden sensitive resources on an enterprise deployment, and a client-side protection module to enforce fine-grained policies for users of the enterprise's web applications. The project will involve developing, analyzing, and improving both of these components using large-scale web applications and will integrate the experience and challenges of enterprises with leading web applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a new approach to analyzing and understanding concisely structured documents such as legal contracts. The success of this project would provide a technological disruption in the way legal documents are processed. This will result in reduced processing time and financial savings in the review of legal contracts. Moreover, achieving this level of disruption within the legal market has the potential to open the door to automate processing, improve quality, and reduce the cost of many other legal services impacting the entire economy. With a market size of $437 Billion within the US alone, the legal industry is ready for a technological disruption that would bring this market up to par with other industries that have been significantly improved with the adoption of cutting edge Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. This underlines the massive commercial potential for the technology under development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project pursues a new innovative approach to understanding and analyzing contracts with accuracy comparable to what can be achieved by humans. Regardless of the technology, accuracy is the most important metric for lawyers to trust and adopt this innovation. Standard NLP techniques cannot generate the desired level of accuracy without a new approach to the problem.  The approach proposed for this project creates innovative custom-defined rules that operate using standard NLP technologies to break a contract into a data structure capturing different aspects of the contract meaning and allowing a higher level of understanding for the contract. In order to achieve the desired accuracy, a new innovative recurrent neural network (RNN) is designed to learn over the extracted contract-meaning-data-structure which significantly improves the accuracy of the entire system. These two steps form somewhat orthogonal learning processes and when coupled with human-supervised-learning can produce the desired accuracy. This project will allow a full assessment of the underlying technology by training the core engine on a sufficiently large corpus of contracts to test the hypothesis on a larger scale.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
    an environmentally benign yet highly effective marine antifouling coating for
    the American yacht market. The coating is a non-biocidal, foul release surface
    which does not require the vessel to move to obtain antifouling protection. It
    is a non-ablative multi-modal coating that will deter settling marine larvae when
    the vessel is stationary and will eliminate any attached marine organisms, such
    as barnacles through self-cleaning (e.g. fouling release) while underway. The
    commercial impact of the innovation will be in reducing consumption of non-renewable
    resources through increased fuel efficiency and possible expansion into additional
    markets. Such additional markets would include those for commercial vessels, Navy
    vessels, bridges, windmills, etc., while successfully reducing harmful chemicals
    in the marine environment. The market for these coatings is expected to double
    in the next four years, currently being at $10.2 billion. The findings from this
    development work will also be incorporated into research based educational programs.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the development of a promising synthetic
    conopeptide analog to the noradrenaline (NA) molecule. Prior art has shown that
    NA, when bound to a surface (or included as part of a coating covering a surface),
    deters fouling marine invertebrates from settling, thus preventing biofouling.
    Another distinct advantage of using conopeptide based systems is their stability
    in the marine environment. The current efforts are focused upon improving the
    efficacy and antifouling performance of these molecules. The phase I research
    objectives are (1) conjugation of the bioactive conopeptide additive to the current
    foul release coating; (2) demonstration of antifouling efficacy and proof of concept
    by bioassay; (3) development of batch coatings for scale-up for marine field tests.
    The results will be useful for designing new test coatings for scale up and testing
    in the marine environment."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make it cheaper and faster for architects, urban planners, and real-estate developers (APDs), as well as many others, to work with detailed models of the real world. Designers in APD fields must visualize and render their projects in the context of the real world. Pictures, videos, 3D printing, and even virtual reality inform the design process and facilitate communication with lay customers and stakeholders. These applications require consistently detailed models of the built world, and this project will automate the generation of these models. We estimate that APDs spend at least $80M annually creating these models by hand; and that at least $300M more is spent on such models for simulations, special effects, and video game design. By algorithmically generating virtual models without human intervention, the significant cost (in time and money) of manual creation will be saved, freeing design professionals to do work they want to be doing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the state of the art in reconstructing highly detailed models of the world for diverse commercial applications. The first hurdle is solving the problem of reconstructing surfaces representing the boundaries of real-world solids (buildings) from noisy point cloud data. While surface reconstruction is well-studied in a variety of contexts, it remains an open problem in general, as successful algorithms must be informed by priors on the intended datasets. Using a data-driven approach to segment and classify input point clouds will facilitate the application of different reconstruction techniques to different objects (e.g. trees or buildings). The second hurdle is development of a machine learning algorithm which handles the dual problems of procedural modeling and inverse procedural modeling from a single statistical model, enabling visually realistic predictions about the details of a given building, even when that information is not available from source data (which may be of inconsistent quality across a large geographic area).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be large: a successful project would transform the construction industry, making it far more efficient by reducing legal conflicts, schedule slips and poor decision making; the project has the potential to make real estate sales and marketing more efficient by allowing buyers and sellers to accurately represent properties online, reducing the need for on-site visits. The proposed work will enable the fast and easy creation of 100% complete visual documentation of a physical space; this documentation can be generated many times throughout the course of construction. In so doing, the proposed project will allow professionals in the construction industry to track progress and communicate with their teams far more efficiently than ever before. A second exciting effect of the proposal will be the creation of vast, detailed, never before seen datasets of construction projects and real estate, allowing technical innovations in artificial intelligence and computer vision to impact one of the largest industries in the nation and the world. For example, systems could be trained to automatically spot safety concerns, augmenting the efforts of safety managers and keeping workers safer than ever before.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a fast, easy to use and cheap method to create photorealistic 3D models using off the shelf consumer hardware. Technical hurdles include validating the quality and efficacy of models generated with consumer hardware, near instantaneous creation of 3D models on device, and automatic creation of routes through the 3D space without human annotation. With these hurdles cleared, advanced work might include automated analytics between and among 3D models of the same site captured over time. Because of the system's ease of use, it will enable the collection of large, totally novel datasets. The goal of the research is to produce a prototype that a layperson can use to create a 3D model of a physical site in order to document it. The plan to reach these goals includes iterative software development against the hurdles listed above, as well as continuous user feedback to guide and refine development.

    Transfer (STTR) project will be the development and commercialization of a novel
    variety of corn that is high in carotenoids and orange in color, and with yields
    that are competitive with today's commercial hybrids.  In the diets of Americans,
    two important antioxidant carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, are in low abundance.
    \ This deficiency has been associated with higher risk for degenerative diseases
    such as Age Related Macular Degeneration, and potentially, dementia. The ultimate
    goal of the proposed research is to get American's to consume more lutein and

    antioxidants in the most widely grown staple crop: Corn. Since corn is used in
    a wide variety of popular processed food formats, improving the carotenoid content
    of corn provides an opportunity to significantly increase the amount of health
    benefiting antioxidants that Americans consume, without changing consumers eating
    habits. However, in order for this strategy to be economically feasible, corn
    varieties that are high in carotenoids must be developed that are also high in

    for favorable alleles of genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis and stability.
    There is considerable genetic variation in genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis
    and stability, however, the most favorable alleles are typically not found in
    varieties that are commercially relevant to US corn production. Thus, the development
    of genetic markers will enable favorable alleles to be moved from lower yielding
    germplasm that is not well adapted to the US Corn Belt into elite inbreds suitable
    for the production of yield-competitive commercial F1 hybrids for the US market.
    The primary goal of this Phase I research is to create user-friendly genetic markers
    associated with favorable alleles for 12 key genes associated with carotenoid
    biosynthesis and stability. These markers will then be validated for efficacy
    by testing their ability to create progenies with higher carotenoid production,
    particularly lutein and zeaxanthin. This will result in a set of markers and experimental
    breeding materials that can be used to rapidly develop fixed inbreds for use in
    the production of yield-competitive high carotenoid F1 hybrids."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project relates to the fact that the extraction and consumption of fossil carbon accounts for over 6 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions each year.  While some mitigation approaches are fairly mature, like capturing CO2 for equestration or for enhanced oil recovery, they are very expensive in terms of both variable and capital costs and have little chance of ever providing a return on investment.  By not viewing fossil fuels and feedstocks through a circular economy lens, we estimate these companies miss an opportunity for approximately $50 billion per year in potential profit from hydrocarbons, including methanol, that could be made with waste CO2. If successful, our HI-Light reactor will enable a new economy based on the conversion of fugitive CO2 into useful hydrocarbons and solve the return on investment problem.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop HI-Light, a solar-thermocatalytic "reverse combustion" technology that enables the conversion of CO2 and water to methanol and other hydrocarbons at rate significantly greater than the state of the art. Previous approaches are limited by two roadblocks: (1) the semiconductor catalysts can only use photons with energies greater than their bandgap, which is a small fraction of those present in sunlight and (2) a large fraction of the catalyst material in these reactors is under-utilized due to sub-optimal light and reactant delivery.  Our unique reactor uses a patented, multiscale approach to enhance light and reagent transport directly to the reaction site and makes use of traditionally unused photons to provide heat and enhance reaction efficiency.  The unique features of our reactor are (1) optimized light delivery to ensure that all of the catalyst material has enough light to activate the reaction and (2) an advanced nano-engineered photocatalyst which is functionalized with ligands to enhance CO2 capture and conversion.  The goal of this Phase I effort is to construct an integrated prototype reactor and evaluate its productivity in terms of the grams of hydrocarbon produced per gram of catalyst per hour and demonstrate a 10x improvement over the state of the art.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR Phase I project
    is to develop a new water flood technology to increase oil recovery.  The best
    current technology is limited to 30 - 50% recovery leaving significant resources
    in the ground.  The available methods to further increase recovery are expensive,
    have limited application and can cause environmental damage.  The proposed method
    is much lower cost and has minimal environmental impact.  Our technique does not
    use chemicals or additives thus avoiding the risk of contaminating ground and
    surface water resources.  Rather than drill thousands of new wells, our approach
    revitalizes old fields and requires little modification to the existing infrastructure
    and operational procedures.  It would allow older fields to continue to operate,
    providing revenues, jobs and taxes while increasing and further diversifying our
    domestic oil reserves.  Development of these currently unrecoverable oil resources
    could enable long-term stabilization of oil prices at reasonable levels and offer
    new business opportunities for small operators.  \n\nThis STTR Phase I project
    proposes to measure the wettability in several petroleum reservoirs and to determine
    the equilibrium constants required to better describe the interaction between
    mineral surfaces and surface-active components of crude oil.  These constants
    will be added to a geochemical model to evaluate the capability of the models
    to predict wettability.  Wettability in petroleum reservoirs is poorly constrained,
    and current formulations that depend on interfacial energy cannot accurately portray
    the observations and offer little predictive capability.  The current wettability
    measurement methodologies rely on flow properties to infer interfacial energy
    because it is difficult to directly measure the interfacial energy between rock
    and oil.  Using a geochemical approach, we can explicitly represent the electrostatic
    and van der Waals force that make up the interfacial energy.  This approach will
    produce quantitative formulations of wettability that can be implemented in standard
    geochemical models.  Our goals are to demonstrate that we can measure the important
    reactions using standard chemical methodologies, that these measurements can be
    used in geochemical models to calculate wettability and that the models can be
    used to predict wettability as a function of water chemistry, for enabling techniques
    for more effective water flooding and enhanced oil recovery."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) will be the development of a dynamic thermal analysis system for use in aseptic food processing.  The true value of thermal properties for specific food products is required for the design of a thermal process to prevent possible bacterial contamination due to underheating, or degradation and formation of unwanted compounds due to overheating.  The proposed innovation would allow food processors to improve their understanding of thermal properties in rapid heating applications, and by validating novel food processing technologies. The impact is expected to be that the quality and nutritional value of aseptic processed foods should increase dramatically as it will eliminate the need to excessively overcook products to ensure their safety. The commercial impact of this research will be through enhancing the quality of aseptic processed food and of rapidly heated batter-based foods. As the aseptic food quality will be further enhanced compared to that of canned and frozen alternatives, this technology will also increase the growth of the rapidly growing aseptic food industry.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial prototype device capable of rapidly measuring the thermal properties of a material over a range of temperatures. Currently, there is no way to quickly measure properties, which are necessary for accurate modeling of rapid heating processes such as those used for aseptic food processing and for foods baked between hot irons, such as burgers. Without rapid measurement, the food product deteriorates before taking measurements. Phase I research should develop, build, and validate a physical prototype and associated software. Control and data acquisition software, along with data analysis and parameter estimation software, will be finalized and validated. The device will be tested against materials with known parameters to statistically validate its performance and accuracy. Finally the device will be tested alongside the prior state-of-the-art to compare its performance to the industry standard. The product of this research will be a commercially-viable prototype that has been validated against literature values and has been demonstrated to outperform current devices. The device will be able to measure parameters over a range of temperatures more accurately and in a fraction of the time of current methodology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes high quality data that indicates a population?s sense of well-being and environmental safety--two essential factors in the effort for long-term sustainability. MindRider and Multimer collect and analyze human signals at the neighborhood, town, city, and regional scale, thus providing proactive, standardized, geospatial, real-time information to improve both personal mobility and urban monitoring. MindRider and Multimer can help overcome limitations in two prevalent monitoring methods: 1) A reactive methodology for quantifying danger is to count accidents. While government-collected accident data is often reliable and includes many years' worth of information, it does not provide precise spatial details such as direction of movement. Most importantly, an injury or fatality must occur before a statistic is produced, which therefore misses all the non-reported minor injuries, as well as perceptions of danger. 2) Many researchers use qualitative instruments like surveys and interviews to study perceptions of safety without the occurrence of an accident But while qualitative methods are highly valuable, these methods cannot be deployed continuously, are often not geospatial, and their results may not be standardized.

    The proposed project addresses the challenges that stakeholders like transportation planners and real estate analysts encounter as they monitor rapid change in cities and towns. For these stakeholders, improved data helps to reduce the complexity, cost, and risk of site selection decisions like choosing the location for a store, transit hub, outdoor advertisement, home, or office. Existing location analysis tools show similar kinds of evaluations for very different neighborhoods, based on limited data that doesn't often change. MindRider, which pairs custom ergonomic biosensors with GPS-enabled smartphones to record EEG and location data, and Multimer, which categorizes and analyzes MindRider data against existing geographic inputs, has the potential to provide key insights for data-driven decision making. We have built the basic system to collect and analyze geolocated biosensor data and have proven the technical feasibility of collecting these data from a pilot sample population for an extended period of time. Our primary objective for Phase I is to improve our data modeling and analysis--with a focus on affective interpretation, biosensor comparison, geospatial and temporal statistics, and reproducibility--so as to offer a fully robust product that stakeholders will confidently integrate into their existing workflows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring agility to the network infrastructure in data center networks.  While modern data centers leverage server virtualization to quickly and easily deploy applications, and storage systems that abstract away the hard drives and enable applications to access any data from any server at any time, the network infrastructure that protects and makes the network more efficient is still largely hardware appliances.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in the number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide data center operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide technical validation for a new approach to network function virtualization, invented at the University of Colorado, Boulder, in which network functions are disaggregated into separate processing and state storage components.  Experiments in the lab have shown seamless scalability, disruptionless failure management, and processing rates in line with other software solutions.  The goal of this project is to run in a production environment (a data center with real traffic) to fully quantify the throughput, latency, scalability, resilience, and cost effectiveness when faced with production conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve occupational safety and health outcomes within the fire service through translational research and development of an affordable wearable physiologic monitoring device. Nearly 50% of firefighter line of duty deaths are the result of sudden cardiovascular events and the societal costs of firefighter injuries are in the billions of dollars, yet many departments cannot afford the costs of implementing the firefighter monitoring programs. Therefore, the use of an affordable wearable which can gather, store and transmit physiological data in real-time has the potential to reduce fatalities, injuries and costs. The affordability of manufacturing the device is the major commercial innovation as it will extend the physiological monitoring capability to workers exposed to extreme environmental conditions such as firefighters, soldiers, chemical and biological lab technicians, and commercial drivers - groups that have not been able to afford the cost of longitudinal and/or real-time physiological monitoring and predictive diagnostics. The affordability of the device will enable researchers to further scientific knowledge correlating the interrelationship between experimental physiological monitoring and field-based data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be in the area of optical materials. Optical materials are widely used in applications such as eyeglasses, cameras, cell phones, fiber-optic cables etc. Novol aims to push the frontiers of innovation in optical material research by creating new polymers with a much better balance of optical properties relative to glass while being tough and lightweight. The goal is to provide significant improvement in vision quality for patients with ophthalmic disorders. Particular benefit could be seen in pediatric and hyperopic prescription markets where choices of lens materials are restricted due to greater demand on lens properties. Long term project goals will focus on making lower-cost and more efficient lens assemblies for imaging, diagnostics and surveillance applications. A parallel aim of the research is to reduce the environmental impact of existing optical polymers, which are often made from highly toxic materials. Commercial opportunity presented through this work will not only benefit the end users but also the lens manufacturers through its ability to utilize safe and bio-derived monomers like sugars for making a highly important category of materials in today?s markets.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to demonstrate optical and mechanical advantages of a new class of polymers made from sugars. Sugars have versatile properties arising from their complex structures, presence of heteroatoms and multiple functional groups. This research aims to bring together principles of organic, polymer and biological chemistry to create a new type of highly transparent, strong and refractive polymers useful in many optical applications, including lenses. Recent innovation in optical materials has focused largely on increasing a singular lens property, refractive index, mainly to afford thinner lenses for prescription eyewear applications. Technical objectives of this work go beyond the need to create just high index optical polymers and focus on making polymers that balance high refractive index with other critical properties of optical materials such as low dispersion of light and desirable mechanical strength. Lens materials with such well-balanced properties are currently unknown and if created, will provide unique advantages for many commercial applications of lenses such as prescription eyewear, sports accessories, camera assemblies and device screens. Another technical objective of this effort will focus on co-polymerization of sugar derivatives with known synthetic polymers to improve the properties and bio-based content of existing polymers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will lie in the improved ability to accurately monitor indoor and outdoor airborne particles using the proposed low-cost, broad size-range, aerosol  sensor to be developed in this research project. Inhalation of aerosol particles can result in adverse human health effects, with the critical parameter from a health effect perspective being the concentration of particles smaller than 2.5µm, i.e. PM2.5. Measurements of PM2.5 are critical to understand the extent of particulate exposure that populations experience in different environments. This project?s proposed approach is to measure particle concentrations by charging them and sensing their abundance using sensitive low-current circuits. This approach allows for measurements over a broad size range and at low-cost. Most of the currently available aerosol sensors are only sensitive to particles larger than ~ 500 nm, and hence are unreliable for ambient measurements. The proposed sensor will, thus, likely generate a significant interest in the aerosol research community and the ambient air quality monitoring industry.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to demonstrate the feasibility of accurate aerosol concentration measurements over a size range of 10 nm to 2.5 µm using an electrical-sensing technique. The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in the novel combination of electrical-mobility aerosol classification, printed electrodes, low-current sensing electronics, and advanced inversion algorithms to result in a low-cost real-time, wide size-range, aerosol sensor. With printed electrodes, the signal response from the sensor can be tailored to be proportional to total particle volume concentration, and, thus, to PM2.5. The research objectives are to demonstrate the accuracy of volume concentration measurements made with our sensor for a range of particle types and size distributions. The successful completion of this project should result in a prototype sensor that can accurately measure total aerosol concentrations in different ambient conditions. This would be a first critical step towards the final development of a low-cost sensor for large-scale air quality measurements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to enable affordable access to quantum annealing quantum computers and to take the complexity out of the programming and application hosting tasks, which currently poses a major barrier of entry for potential users. The company expects quantum computing technology in the next few years to disrupt significant portions of the high-performance-computing environment for optimization problems, which has previously been characterized by slow and incremental performance improvements. This project would yield a platform that both increases the efficiency and lowers the cost of analyzing complex optimization problems, which could spur fast-paced innovation in wide areas of the economy that tackle such issues. These sectors include energy distribution, pharmaceutical design, cancer research, data analytics, cybersecurity, autonomous systems, planning and scheduling activities, financial services such as risk management and portfolio optimization, and basic and applied research in physics and chemistry.  In each of these disciplines, there are optimization-based computational problems that are currently intractable. The results of this research should enable a much larger community of experts to use the power of quantum computing to solve these important but currently intractable problems.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the need for a cloud-based platform for using quantum annealing computing technology. Quantum annealing computers have come to market in the last few years, and research laboratories and universities have used these machines to explore algorithms that could eventually be solved efficiently on them. Despite advances in performance of quantum annealing computers, little effort has been directed toward developing programming environments and tools that provide simple and inexpensive access to quantum computing capabilities. This project researches a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) with a suite of front-end and back-end tools that efficiently transform high-level computing problems into binary optimization formulations suitable for quantum annealing, simplifying and automating the low-level details and domain knowledge currently necessary to perform useful calculations. This project will further develop the PaaS to include a classical-quantum computing environment and framework for analysis of large data sets using standard distributed computing tools. The research explores the best software tools and platform methods to integrate emerging quantum computing capabilities into workflows by streamlining and making affordable the processing of data and by decomposing real-world problems into sub-problems amenable to quantum computers of today and in the future.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be commercially deployable equipment for screening, detecting, and removing aflatoxin contaminated corn from the global food supply. Exposure to aflatoxin, a dangerous fungal carcinogen, has been linked to liver cancer, childhood stunting, illness and death in humans and animals, and major economic losses for farmers and grain handlers in the U.S. and globally. Rapid batch screening equipment will expand the capacity of the grain industry to test more corn for aflatoxin contamination and minimize the high sampling error that currently plagues the aflatoxin testing process and risks greater contamination exposure downstream. In addition to batch screening equipment, opportunities also exist to develop handheld devices to identify contaminated corn in the field, and continuous flow optical sorters, deployed at grain handling and food processing facilities, to remove the contaminated corn and protect the market value of the healthy grain. The goal is to 1) Increase revenue for farmers in the U.S. and globally; 2) Protect the food supply and reduce the risks of greater contamination exposure for farmers, grain handlers, and consumers; and 3) Protect feed supply and improve productivity of livestock.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a specialized high resolution imaging system for rapid batch screening of aflatoxin in corn.  The research team will build the prototype unit and image processing software with the patented algorithm for detection of aflatoxin in corn, integrated with a high resolution, dual-camera system. With existing chemical tests for aflatoxin detection, it is difficult for grain handlers to test larger samples or every truck without causing major delays in operations. The key technical hurdle for rapid batch screening with this technology is reliable imaging analysis of sufficient size samples, screened fast enough for the imaging system to fit into commercial grain handling operations without disruption.  By screening hundreds of corn samples with the rapid batch screening prototype unit, the team will validate device accuracy of >95% true positive and true negative for detection of corn contaminated with aflatoxin, consistently across contamination ranges and proportions, at a processing speed fast enough to be deployed by commercial grain handlers on every truckload.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, and of its underlying technological innovation, is in enabling a diverse variety of applications involving interactive and immersive media, which are central to several sectors that are poised to grow substantially in the coming years. Specifically, the low-latency audio technology developed in the project is a critical enabler for the development of future products that are of significant value to several sectors of the technology industry including, most importantly, the enabling of fully immersive interactive media products for augmented reality games and related applications. Additional impact is expected in the advancement and support of musical collaboration over the internet and enabling remote music education, both with clear cultural and educational implications. Another significant impact is in enabling a truly realistic teleconferencing experience with considerable implications for both business and social networks, with the latter further providing a realistic alternative to fully interactive social gatherings of groups and families without recourse to costly travel.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a novel paradigm for coding and networking of polyphonic audio content at low-latency via efficient prediction, which is critical to numerous applications in the emerging field of interactive immersive hyper-realistic multimedia. Polyphonic audio, or the mixture of multiple periodic components plus noise, has long resisted effective prediction, thus forcing state-of-the-art coders to either employ long transformation that incurs substantial delay and is incompatible with applications requiring low latency, low complexity and low bitrate, or accept significantly degraded performance. This project develops technologies that approach optimal performance despite constraints on latency, complexity and bit rate, by effectively exploiting temporal redundancies in all periodic components of polyphonic audio signals. Specifically, the coding paradigm builds on the novel technique of cascaded long term prediction, which enables joint prediction of all periodic components in the mixture, at low delay. This prediction approach is complemented by the development of powerful low-complexity parameter estimation techniques to minimize resource requirements, effective adaptation to fundamental frequency changes, side information optimization to minimize bitrate costs, practical redesign of all coder modules to fully exploit the prediction capabilities, and enhanced error-resilience for streaming over lossy packet networks.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve critical power budget issues in next generation wearable computing applications. Candidate applications require ultra-low power, require massive context-awareness computation, and need to perform in the noisy real world.  A large gap exists between consumer expectation and what can be realized using conventional circuit techniques. Reconfigurable and biologically inspired classifiers use proprietary mixed signal approaches that uniquely close wearable computing's power/performance gap.  Our Phase I deliverables focus on completing a minimum viable product (MVP) that will use gesture recognition to wake up/control behavior of a wearable device with a power budget in the low micro-watt range.  The demonstration would use programmable neural classifier engines acting on sensor stimulus to perform gesture recognition. This important step will allow the further development of the technology portfolio for a broader range of applications.

    The proposed project's central innovation lies in the mixed-signal approach to embedded computing to shatter the energy efficiency barrier of traditional digital systems. The Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) approach incorporates neuromorphic circuits which approach 5GMAC/uW processing efficiency for high-level classification tasks. The Long-term vision is to address a broad range of end applications through a family of mixed signal integrated circuits based on a novel and programmable architecture that operates at 2 orders of magnitude less power than a comparable digital implementation; to deliver solutions that are the world's most energy efficient implementation. When classification tasks which formerly required at least 10mW to perform can be accomplished within 100uW, a vast range of applications become possible. The impact will be most profoundly felt in the design of next generation portable devices- in particular complex event tracking functions in wireless sensor motes (enabling the Internet-of-Things (IoT)), next generation devices for wearable computing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes: 1) development of novel encryption and authentication technology to improve cybersecurity and 2) the reduction of economic loss due to data breaches.  The larger societal need for new technologies in the cyber arena has been well documented over the past 10 years.  With the growing dependence on computers in practically every aspect of modern life, use of social media, large industries moving towards high performance (faster) computing networks and the coming era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the market for cyber technology is expected to grow at a steady rate of as much as 15% annually.  This project will create a high speed, parallel and Truly-Random Number Generator (TRNG) with signal embedding capabilities.  With an optical core, the device will have advantages over many of the currently available, pseudo-RNG devices based on silicon chip technologies that have been shown vulnerable to hackers.  Additionally, this device will provide a framework for continuous development and possible online authentication features to compliment the hardware.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in development of a prototype device to assess the feasibility of a commercial product.  The basis of the innovation is the use of quantum phenomena in optics to create randomness, also known as noise.  Quantum mechanics has proven to be the underlying mechanism for noise processes used the world over in encryption of data.  In this case, the process of creating noise can be adjusted, oscillated at some frequency, to produce embedded signals overlaid with the random output.  This gives the final design applications well beyond encryption.  With the rise of high performance computing networks in scientific simulations, health care patient tracking, financial institution accessibility, education, etc., the ability to use the embedding feature to track authentication credentials and perform continuous monitoring of equipment accessing a network becomes paramount to securing networks as well as data.  During this project the basic design will be refined with the aim of producing a rescaled, commercial product.

    Research Phase I project will be better preservation of perishable food produce.
    \ The proposed new functionalized packaging film for perishable foods, incorporates
    innovative technologies to eliminate harmful microbes, lock in just-harvested
    aroma and taste, extend shelf-life from field to the kitchen table, and reduce
    food waste. These benefits will accrue to farmers and field workers, to shippers
    and truckers, to retailers who realize less produce waste, and o consumers. The
    proposed technology incorporates a novel nano-adsorbent metal organic framework

    microbial protection, slow down the ripening process during shipment and deliver
    just-harvested quality in our fruits and vegetables. MOFs are a novel material
    technology which potentially could transform packaging from ?just plastic bags?
    to true active packaging.\n \nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research
    project are to determine the technical feasibility to extrude a multi-layer film
    with the nano-adsorbent metal organic framework (MOF) material incorporated in
    a layer within linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) film. This functionalized
    film structure will be selectively permeable via the embedded MOF structures to
    allow the exchange of gases, including ethylene, O2, CO2, other biologically active
    gases and certain antimicrobial compounds such as chlorine dioxide. Control of
    fruit and vegetable respiration (O2/CO2 balance), control endogenous and exogenous
    ethylene, and the delivery antimicrobial gases via MOFs could be the single most
    important recent technology breakthrough that allows producers in distant markets
    to delivery fresh produce. This research project will seek to identify MOFs with
    the appropriate gas exchange properties, heat stability in the blown film extrusion
    process and proper orientation within the film structure. Collaborative research
    is needed to select likely MOF candidates, to incorporate these MOFs in films
    extruded on pilot scale equipment, and to characterize effectiveness at a university-based
    postharvest laboratory to enable rapid technology development, impartial assessments,
    and effective reduction to practice."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the creation of a new tool that could prevent the loss of sensitive data stored in big data management systems due to various cyberattacks. Furthermore, the proposed tool can allow organizations to audit big data usage to prevent abuse and misuse of the stored data. The existence of such a novel tool may increase trust in these big data management systems, and protect the sensitive data stored in such systems against various outsider and insider attacks. The company believes that such a tool would address an important customer need and has the potential to have significant commercial impact as more and more companies are adopting big data management technologies such as Hadoop and Spark. The company plans to pursue a freemium business model and open source some of the developed code. This in turn may improve the data protection capabilities provided by existing freely available open source tools that can be used by many different companies and organizations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will prove the feasibility of a novel big data privacy, security and governance management tool.  This new tool will provide enhanced security and privacy protection capabilities such as enforcing privacy policies using on-the-fly data masking, enforcing security policies using role-based access control techniques, and enforcing governance policies using data encryption, and advanced auditing and accountability features in one tool without the need to modify/change the underlying big data management system. To successfully develop the proposed prototype, the company will address many technical challenges such as developing efficient privacy-preserving policy enforcement solutions with very little overhead, and designing an interactive user interface that supports easy governance and privacy policy specification tasks. To address these technical challenges, the company proposes to leverage recent advances in aspect oriented programming to inject code directly into submitted data analysis jobs in a seamless manner to enable transparent data encryption, data sanitization, and accountability, compliance and governance policy enforcement. Using this injected code, the data that is stored in encrypted format could be decrypted and sanitized before it is used for data analysis as needed. Furthermore, necessary logs could be generated for accountability purposes.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is developing and producing a sustainable ink
    for the printing industry. Ink is commonly used in a variety of applications,
    and billions of pounds of ink are produced annually.  The majority of chemicals
    within ink are petroleum based and are mined from the earth.  These chemicals
    also are toxic to humans and the environment. Nature has produced a multitude
    of molecules capable of replacing components currently utilized in ink. While
    many organisms that produce these replacement molecules are slow growing and require
    energy sources like sugar, photosynthetic microbes, specifically cyanobacteria,
    are capable of being engineered to generate some of these replacement molecules
    in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe,
    renewable and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing
    packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating
    these ink products will decrease the overall detrimental impact of traditional
    inks on the environment and human health. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop sustainable ink formulations using engineered cyanobacteria cells capable
    of generating cellular pigments that will make the cultures optically black in
    appearance.  These optically black cells will act as pigments that replace mined
    pigments found in traditional ink formulations. This project uses entire cyanobacteria
    cells in ink formulations so that extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary,
    thus saving energy and reducing cost.  While currently utilized pigments used
    for ink are minerals mined from the ground such as carbon black, which is a finite
    material, cyanobacteria are a renewable source of biomass for bio-products, as
    these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide, wastewater and land otherwise
    unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly generate biomass. In addition
    to the development of renewable cyanobacteria strains considered to be optically
    black, this project will develop optimal growth conditions as well as techno-economic
    models leveraging these strains within several subsets of the ink industry.  Using
    cyanobacteria to produce ink products is a novel application, which will be a
    major breakthrough for the algal bio-products industry."

    Research Phase I project is to reduce the cost of formulating laundry detergents

    reduces environmental impact to waterways. \n\nThe technical objectives in this

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is the commercialization of a novel electrolytic process to manufacture low-cost, high-power graphite for electric vehicle batteries. Electrolytically synthesized graphite offers the opportunity to utilize domestically available sources of renewable electricity and carbon dioxide and secure the supply chain for battery production with domestic production capacity. The impact on society that will be created by the commercialization of a novel graphite synthesis process is a significant decrease in graphite manufacturing cost and a more sustainable manufacturing process from domestically available sources of renewable electricity and carbon dioxide.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to 1) demonstrate effective purification of electrolytically synthesized graphite using supercritical carbon dioxide and 2) recover a high yield of extracted by-products. Currently the purification process mimics the high-temperature thermal purification step of the commercial graphite manufacturing process. However, this process is time consuming, energy intensive, and therefore costly. Supercritical fluids purification has the potential to significantly reduce the purification time, energy cost, and the environmental footprint of electrolytically manufactured graphite. The purification process will be optimized by controlling carbon dioxide pressure, temperature, flow rate, water addition, and extraction time.

    temperature Diesel exhaust, where traditionally injection of Diesel Exhaust Fluid
    (DEF; urea water solution) has not been feasible due to risks of urea crystallization;
    crystallization itself has been a major warranty challenge in the Diesel vehicle
    industry particularly in heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses operating in
    city-mode driving conditions.  It is anticipated that the proposed novel mixer
    will minimize urea crystallization risks, accelerate rates of thermolysis and
    hydrolysis reactions in the Diesel exhaust and enable the Selective Catalytic
    Reduction (SCR) catalyst reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx) at temperatures well below
    the current limit of 200 °C.  By removing these barriers, the technology developed
    in this project  will enable low temperature reduction of Diesel exhaust NOx,
    known to both harm human health and increase greenhouse gases.  The proposed innovation
    will likely also provide economic value consisting of vehicle component cost savings,
    major warranty cost reduction and reduced fuel consumption."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project includes the development of new methods to biodegrade waste plastics. Plastic waste is an significant environmental burden. Over 300 million tons of plastic are used each year, resulting in millions of tons of persistent plastic waste, some of which can take up to 600 years to degrade. Mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) can digest polystyrene, also known as Styrofoam, a persistent and widespread source of plastic waste. Beta Hatch Inc. is developing a novel approach to reduce plastic waste. As the mealworms feed, they convert polystyrene into protein and biological waste (frass), both valuable nutrient inputs for animal feed or for fertilizer. This project will screen mealworm strains to identify the best candidates for optimization, develop polystyrene feed mixes to improve the efficiency of digestion, and test the end-products to understand how these might be commercial used. The project will also confirm the safety of polystyrene derived biological products (mealworm protein and frass) for use in the production of non-food animals and fiber crops. This work will support the development of novel and commercially viable approaches for biodegradation of plastics.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop the commercial potential of mealworms for plastic bioremediation. Polystyrene (PS) is a synthetic long-chain hydrocarbon polymer. It is a major waste product that takes up 30% of landfill space. The formation of strong molecular bonds between neighboring styrene monomers makes polystyrene extremely stable and therefore extremely difficult to degrade. Mealworms are the only proven organism capable of depolymerizing and mineralizing polystyrene, with the help of beneficial gut microbes. However, for polystyrene biodegradation to be commercially viable, the efficiency of digestion needs to be increased, and the safety of products derived from PS feeding needs to be assessed. Existing work has shown that there is strain-specific variability in PS digestion, and that PS digestion efficiency is only ~50% without additional nutrients. Further, PS feeding may decrease the fertility of mealworms, which would limit the long-term commercial feasibility of mealworm based PS-digestion. This project will identify mealworm strains that show high potential for polystyrene (PS) digestion, test the ability to breed animals with enhanced PS capability, develop feed mixes for optimal efficiency of PS biodigestion, quantify impacts of PS feeding on mealworm life cycles, and collect preliminary data on toxicity of PS-derived biomass and frass products. These experiments support the objectives of 1) identifying pathways for scaling up PS biodigestion by mealworms,  2) integration of PS wastes as a feed for mealworm farming, and 3) collection of key data on the marketability of end-products from polystyrene digestion. This feasibility project&#8232;will also catalyze conversations with customers and regulators on the business challenges and opportunities associated with plastic biodigestion.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent or reduce the high risk of post-meniscectomy
    osteoarthritis (OA) following partial meniscectomy which is a popular treatment
    for meniscus tears. Meniscus tears represent common lesions injuries prevailing
    in ~36% of people with ages at and greater than 45 years old, but with few effective

    in the U.S. The drawback of meniscectomy is significant increases of incidence
    of osteoarthritis (OA) later in life (by as high as 7 folds), because loss of
    meniscus causes altered load transmission, decreased shock absorption, and decreased
    joint stability and increased joint cartilage contact stress. Post-meniscectomy
    osteoarthritis (OA) is well documented in literatures. OA is more challenging

    This SBIR phase I project seeks to address the critical need for lung cancer diagnosis at an early stage. North America has the highest age-standardized incidence of lung cancer in the world. An estimated 224,390 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed this year and 158,080 deaths are predicted to occur due to lung cancer in 2016. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer patients is much lower when compared to other common cancers due to late-stage diagnosis of the disease in these patients. The survival rate for lung cancer patients significantly improves when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. Early detection of lung cancer by computed tomography scanning is disadvantageous to high false positive rates and the need for invasive and expensive follow-up procedures. The breath analysis technology described in this project can mitigate this health crisis by drastically reducing false positives, lowering the cost of diagnosis and reducing the need for repeated radiographic scans or invasive biopsies. Moreover, the cutting-edge breath analysis technology described in this project can be used for other applications, such as environmental monitoring or detecting other diseases including cancers elsewhere in the body.

    The central innovation proposed in this project is a silicon microreactor consisting of micropillars coated with a carbonyl-selective reagent that covalently captures volatile carbonyls of cancer metabolism exhaled in alveolar breath. The microreactor retains the adducts of these metabolic markers, concentrating them up to 10,000-fold, while allowing all other tidal breath components to pass through unaffected. The biomarker adducts of the chemoselective reagent are eluted from the microreactor using methanol and then quantified via mass spectrometry. Elevated concentrations of certain carbonyl biomarkers are indicative of cancer. The Phase I research objectives are to demonstrate the effectiveness of newly engineered, fast-flow microreactors coated with chemoselective reagents designed for enhanced reactions with unsaturated aldehydes. The microreactor design will be optimized so as to evacuate exhaled breath samples through the microreactors at 10-fold the current rate without compromising VOC capture efficiencies. Also, new hydrazine-based reagents will be synthesized to serve as microreactor coatings in combination with the current carbonyl-selective microreactor coating. These innovations will enable the microreactor approach to overcome the critical challenges faced by current breath analysis technologies for early detection of lung cancer.

    Research Phase I project is to improve respiratory protection against ammonia
    by using novel carbide-derived carbons (CDCs). The outcome of this project will
    improve the safety and health for industrial workers, firefighters, and first
    responders that encounter ammonia in industrial settings and emergency situations.
    Current respiratory protection gas masks attempt to prevent users from breathing
    ammonia by trapping the toxic gas on an adsorbent material. Adsorbents on the
    market provide limited protection time against ammonia due to poor attractive
    forces between the adsorbent and ammonia. CDCs overcome these limitations through
    a new synthesis procedure that creates ammonia-specific active sites within its
    structure to bind and trap ammonia. Research on these materials will unlock the
    tools and methods necessary to tailor these adsorbents to other toxic gases. The
    proposed R&D activities address a commercial opportunity within the respiratory
    protection market estimated to be a $6 billion market globally, and $2.4 billion
    market in the U.S. \n\nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research project
    are to synthesize CDCs that can be easily integrated within a filter cartridge
    and to provide an order of magnitude increase in protection time against ammonia
    compared to current materials. CDCs have promising performance and an enormous
    amount of research activity has been devoted to the synthesis and characterization
    of CDCs for adsorptive applications. However, to date, no commercial adsorptive
    applications of these materials exist. This situation exists in part because insufficient
    attention has been paid to the integration of selective gas adsorption sites,
    control of particle size, and hydrothermal stability, all of which are key technical
    hurdles that will be addressed in this project. This goal will be accomplished
    by synthesizing and testing granular CDCs for selective adsorption of ammonia
    from air, integrating further ammonia-specific active sites via post-synthesis
    modification techniques, and evaluating hydrodynamic and thermal stability of
    CDCs through cyclical stability testing methods. The results from this project
    will significantly further our understanding of CDCs in terms of large particle
    size synthesis, long term stability, and tailored active sites for gas capture.
    The anticipated results would significantly further CDCs for ammonia filtration
    and other commercial separations applications."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be a significant improvement in the control of dangerous mosquitoes that transmit serious diseases to humans, including Zika fever, malaria, encephalitis, chikungunya, and dengue fever. This project will generate a novel larvicide directed against the larvae of harmful mosquitoes that live in water. The larvicide is combined with an efficient lure to generate effective bait-and-kill stations that will target only harmful mosquito species. An efficient, inexpensive, safe product to kill mosquito larvae will improve public health since it will greatly reduce the number of adult mosquitoes capable of infecting humans with diseases. The product will protect non-target species and will not contaminate the water with toxins. This project incorporates several new technologies that are also  applicable  to  the  future  control  of  other insect pest species, including a novel design system to produce lures that attract mosquito larvae to bait stations, a new method to kill insect larvae while leaving other species unharmed, and a new method to package the control product. The product and the methods discussed are new, address unmet health and safety needs in several countries, and are expected to have widespread market appeal.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are focused on providing novel attractants for the aquatic larvae of Aedes aegypti and other harmful mosquitos, and combining these lures with a novel larvicide that will eradicate the targeted larvae without contaminating the water column with insecticide or harming non-target species. The mosquito?s range is expanding and traditional control methods are becoming problematic. An effective bait-and-kill device would avoid the wide dispersal of broad-range insecticides and protect the environment, beneficial species, and humans. However, this device requires an efficient attractant to selectively lure mosquito larvae and an effectual, yet selective, larvicide that will not harm non-target species or contaminate  the  water.  These are therefore the foci  of this project.  This project incorporates several novel approaches to develop a microencapsulated nanoparticle that will function as a targeted larvicide. To achieve the stated goals, compounds that strongly attract mosquito larvae will be combined with a nonpoisonous polymer larvicide that is active only uponingestion by the larvae.  The anticipated end product is a bait-and-kill device for A. aegypti larvae that would allow a shift away from broad-spectrum insecticides to a more targeted, responsible control methodology. The platform technologies are applicable to other species in the future.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a large-scale process for production of vault-stabilized enzymes. This project will develop a new nanoparticle-based technology for stabilizing enzymes so that they can be used for industrial applications and environmental cleanup such as water treatment. By employing a scalable, high yield, low cost manufacturing system for vault-enzymes, the company would be able to deploy a variety of new products into the field for treating certain environmental pollutants in drinking water, groundwater, wastewater, and reclaimed water. This would give environmental engineers and regulatory agencies new tools to clean and protect national natural resources and public health.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop a yeast-based production system for nano-scale vault particles. Vault nanoparticles are promising candidates to stabilize and enhance the performance of enzymes for catalytic industrial applications and biotransformation. The packaging of enzymes into vault particles combines enzyme purification and immobilization into a single manufacturing step, and is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly approach for immobilizing and protecting enzymes. Demonstrating feasibility of this system will allow simple integration of vault-enzymes into industrial manufacturing systems and would allow vault enzyme prototypes to be rapidly scaled up and deployed for specific environmental remediation targets.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to significantly reduce the electricity consumed by cooling and refrigeration systems. Cooling systems consume nearly 10% of the electricity generated in the United States. During summer months, cooling and refrigeration systems are needed the most, but are also when they are the least efficient. This results in a significant strain on our nation's electricity grid. By improving the efficiency of cooling systems, less electricity will be needed at the utility scale, particularly during peak hours and in the summer. Furthermore, operators of commercial cooling systems could reduce their overall electricity expenses and increase their revenues and profits. The project?s outcomes will also create a pathway to improve the efficiency of cooling systems that does not involve the use of increasingly scarce freshwater resources, and could eventually lead to more water-efficient cooling systems at the largest scales. Finally, this project's approach harnesses renewable resource, the sky, which is source of cooling that is currently untapped.


    The technical innovation being proposed harnesses a renewable resource, the sky, through a mechanism known as radiative sky cooling, to dramatically improve the efficiency of cooling systems. By using specialized optical surfaces that reject heat as thermal radiation to the sky, while simultaneously reflecting nearly all incident sunlight, it is possible to passively cool below the air temperature 24 hours a day. In this project, a refrigeration system incorporating such surfaces will be developed with the aim of demonstrating improved efficiency over conventional systems. In this process no water is evaporated and the only electricity needed is for pumping. Furthermore, modeling will be performed to understand how such a system could be scaled up for use in larger deployments. At the end of the&#8232;Phase I project, a pathway towards large-scale deployment of a transformative clean energy technology, used to improve the efficiency of cooling systems, will be demonstrated.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a point-of-care (POC) blood chemistry test that can measure multiple analytes simultaneously with a single drop of blood. Blood chemistry tests are the most frequently ordered tests by physicians. This proposed lab-on-a-chip and associated analyzer for blood chemistry tests will benefit society by improving the quality of health care delivery and reducing costs. This device?s minimally invasive procedure reduces: fear and discomfort caused by needles, level of skill needed for sample collection, and errors associated with pre-analytical testing steps. The device?s patent-protected optode technology, which utilizes the color spectrum to measure concentrations, differentiates it from electrochemical technology, which is used by competing POC devices. Briefly, optode technology has lower manufacturing complexity, requires much less blood, has a more robust output, and can test more analytes simultaneously. The initial target application will be neonatal blood chemistry testing because of a strong need to minimize blood draw volumes. Upon clinical acceptance of the technology in the neonatal market, the simple-to-use platform will be expanded to other applications, including acute care centers, first responders, primary care, military care, and disaster relief organizations. This platform will also be expanded to test many other analytes, and should help create many new U.S. jobs in the process.

    The proposed optode-based lab-on-a-chip device will be capable of testing various analytes simultaneously with a single drop of blood, which has not been achieved by commercial POC devices. This innovative optode technology has several advantages over electrochemical technology. First, the optode technology enables extremely small sample volume requirements compared to electrochemical sensors (6-10 ìL vs. 65-100 ìL) and eliminates the need for mixing of reagents. Second, fabrication complexity is greatly simplified using optodes because it requires less layers, less raw materials, and simpler manufacturing steps. Third, optode technology provides a more robust output by using a combination of multiple wavelengths on the visual light spectrum and not a single current output as used in electrochemical technology. Finally, this platform technology will result in unique multiplex analyte combinations, including the first ever handheld basic metabolic panel (BMP) test that requires just a single drop of blood. The primary goal of this
    Phase I SBIR is to demonstrate feasibility of this micro-dispensed, lab-on-a-chip system to evaluate clinical samples. In this one-year project, Objective 1 will develop automated sensor manufacturing methods. Objective 2 will confirm the performance of the developed lab-on-a-chip to quantify analytes in sera samples in FDA-required non-clinical tests and when compared to an FDA-approved, POC analyzer.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to transform how substance use disorders (SUDs) are diagnosed, monitored and treated by creating an integrated technology platform for health care providers. One important application is the early detection of risky substance use behavior that, if treated in the beginning stages, will reduce the rate of fully developed SUDs. The research and development performed on this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be key to creating a novel bio-sensor based approach to diagnosing, monitoring and treating substance abuse patients.  The collected bio-sensor data can also inform treatment solutions to help address this tremendous problem, which affects millions of people, costs the US economy billions of dollars annually, and incurs a significant human cost in terms of lost lives, broken families, and unfulfilled potential.  There is also strong demand for a robust solution in places where substance use detection and monitoring is mandated for safety reasons, including the court system and the military services, as well as occupations like air traffic controllers, pilots, train operators, truck drivers, bus drivers, and operators of heavy machinery.

    The proposed project will focus on integrating biosensors with smartphone technology to detect, collect, transmit, store, and analyze relevant biodata and to push resulting behavior change instructions to the user. By establishing a connection between the sensors and a smartphone application we will report substance abuse treatment outcome data much more accurately than is currently possible via self-reporting.  This system will address engineering, manufacturing, and calibration challenges of a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This technology bypasses the limitations of existing methods with a dramatically different approach. The technology aims to greatly simplify the process of SUD diagnosis and treatment by empowering health care providers to implement accurate data collection, early detection, and custom-tailored intervention within the context of any routine office visit.  The proposed project will address the development of a substance use measuring biosensor and assess the sensor lifetime, stability, reproducibility, and sensitivity.  It is intended to develop a biosensor that patients can wear for a period of time, that we can establish a meaningful connection between the sensor and the mobile application to replace self-reporting, and that concept support can be gained from broader representation of primary care physicians and major insurance companies

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project includes a significant impact on the electric power contingency analysis conducted by industries around the globe. The proposed algorithm can be used by power system planning units, operators, utility companies, universities, and research centers and provides designers, engineers, and scientists with the opportunity of a considerable reduction in computation efforts in performing power grid dynamic simulations, especially in the grids with high penetration of renewable and small-scale generators. It allows conducting more studies in shorter time and leads to significant personnel and equipment cost reduction. In addition, the proposed algorithm is a significant step forward towards realizing a real-time power system analyzer, which can be used to alleviate the adverse effects of faults and disturbances in small and large electric power systems.  Thus, the proposed algorithm potentially helps enhance modern power system reliability and resiliency by providing a fast and accurate analysis of the system under various possible contingencies. As the power grid is one of the most important and fundamental infrastructures in each society, the proposed project will directly enhance social welfare.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a software program for dynamic analysis of power grids. In electric power industries, grid simulators are vital tools to evaluate and analyze dynamic behavior of the grid. Power grids are large-scale networks that are mathematically modeled by thousands of variables and equations. Analysis of such a large number of variables and equations is very time-consuming. Integration of intermittent renewable energy resources as well as small-scale low-inertia generators to modern power grids make the network analysis even more challenging. In the proposed algorithm (to become a software program) a novel mathematical solver is proposed that significantly reduces the computations required to solve the well-known differential-algebraic equations describing power systems. The proposed algorithm contributes to the reduction of the size of the Jacobian matrix and removal of the error loop in the power grid dynamic simulations. These improvements significantly increase the speed of the proposed software program in analyzing dynamic behavior of power grids when compared to the available methods. Preliminary studies show that the proposed power grid simulator can perform at least 30 times faster than the standard Newton-Raphson algorithm when simulating large grids with significant number of generators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to address the grand challenge of human-induced nitrogen loading to the environment. An easy-to-use and affordable system will target a major source of nitrogen releases to watersheds: the on-site systems that treat wastewater from millions of households and commercial facilities across the U.S.  The need to mitigate harmful algal blooms and prevent other damaging cumulative effects to aquatic ecosystems have created an urgent demand for onsite technologies that remove nitrogen at its source. The proposed nitrogen removal technology is modular and adaptable for use in small-scale systems that treat wastewater from individual homes, community systems and commercial establishments. The project employs an innovative biological nitrogen removal process that that will be verified and optimized for high priority applications in rural, peri-urban, and urban settings. The system is mechanically simple, generates no waste products, and operates passively with minimal maintenance, energy or consumables.  The results from this project will help to solve the critical challenge of nitrogen control by providing a highly efficient, low-cost, commercializable system that is practicable for on-site wastewater treatment in new and retrofit systems.

    The technical objectives of this Phase I research project are to design, construct, field-test, and critically evaluate variant prototypes of an innovative bioreactor system to remove nitrogen from onsite wastewater.  Prototype bioreactors will be operated and monitored over multiple months to investigate their salient operational characteristics and define effective design and treatment regimes.  The bioreactors will be installed to treat real household wastewater under field conditions.  Nitrogen analytes will be monitored across the bioreactor systems to delineate the effects of biotreatment on four nitrogen species: organic nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite.  The effects of the biotreatment system on chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, inorganic chemical parameters, and other wastewater constituents of interest will also be elucidated.  The project will critically evaluate the effectiveness of total nitrogen removal and the stability and resiliency of individual nitrogen removal transformations.  The work will confirm the longevity and robustness of the nitrogen removal process and identify design and operating parameters that optimize an innovative approach to remove total nitrogen from on-site wastewater while mitigating nitrogen releases to the environment.  Prototype design and monitoring will facilitate scale-up of results to full-scale biotreatment systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the areas of risk management, data collection, and participation/growth in the agricultural sector. With the proposed platform, individuals with investment capital will be paired with individuals who have access to infrastructure and management expertise. This will allow small-scale farmers to invest in other farmers to diversify their operations, creating a more reliable income stream and consequently increasing the stability and resilience of small farms, which will greatly benefit the rural economy. Incentivizing these farmers to upload data to improve projection accuracy will result in more robust datasets that can be used to compare and optimize farming practices. The micro-consortia that will be formed will reduce barriers to entry in the agricultural sector by facilitating remote transactions, contracts, and management. This platform could eventually help farmers in developing countries produce agricultural goods with the financial help and expertise of more established farms in the developed world. By increasing participation in agriculture and improving upon current farming practices around the world, this platform can help feed the world's growing population for years to come.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to generate better agricultural decision making and implementation tools by improving upon existing data sets. Massive amounts of data are being collected by farming operations, but that data is often difficult to manage. This project can help farmers utilize this information by providing visual tools to make advanced data analysis and decision-making more intuitive and user-friendly. The feasibility depends on developing an accurate decision support system as well as providing actionable recommendations to incentivize the use of the tools. The goal of the project is to develop the main simulation tool for a decision support platform, along with easy-to-understand visualizations of different investment projections and their impact on income. Finally, users will be given the ability to act upon the recommendations from the analysis immediately and directly from the analysis platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an infrastructure for exposing and interpreting a previously unavailable dataset: fine-grained human interaction with a physical environment. Humans are continuously building and shaping the world but there exists little data to examine these effects. Beyond retail, this technology could affect how teachers layout classrooms, how disaster workers provide relief, or how factories keep their workers safe. The subtle physical details that affect humans everyday will be understood and investigated in ways not possible without the proposed system. This technology will benefit society specifically by improving the economic efficiency of retailers and broadly by increasing scientific understanding of how humans interact with their physical environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project uses a neural network and generic 3D scene reconstruction in combination with low-cost, wireless cameras to model an environment with accurate object classification and spatial relationships. Recently, neural networks have proven adept at a variety of image classification tasks but their applications in video classification, namely for human actions, have been less explored. 3D scene reconstruction has made similar advances, progressing from images to videos but has always required some prior knowledge of the physical scene. Within the past year, multiple groups have proposed methods for completely generic scene reconstruction from multiple view cameras. Finally, energy harvesting methods for devices such as cameras and wireless transmitters have been demonstrated to be feasible in laboratory experiments but have not been incorporated into commercial products. In this project the two computer vision algorithms will be developed in parallel with camera hardware so that the software and hardware systems may be integrated and demonstrated by the end of the project.

    in facial expression, text content, tone of voice, speech rate, gestures, posture
    and other body language. Among these, speech prosody, linguistic content, and
    facial expression have proven to be strong indicators of emotional valence (attitude)
    and psychomotor activation (energy level). VSI system research will identify measurable
    traits that support rapid learning and successful performance in activities and
    occupations that require teamwork or social skill.  The VSI app collects performance
    data (voice and screen-touch tracks) on mobile devices to investigate novel combinations
    of features from speech and motion that accelerate and improve trait measurement.
    The project will generate new knowledge about how the relationships between speech

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is about empowering C program developers with correct and complex program transformation tools that they can use to not only improve the quality of C programs but also make the programs more secure against well-known vulnerabilities. C, in spite of its popularity, has integrated development environments (IDEs) with a limited portfolio of such power tools, with limited scalability and limited applicability to real-world programs. Successfully addressing the limitations present in existing tools and providing a robust program transformation infrastructure should fundamentally change how developers work on C code since refactoring is an integral part of software development practices for other programming languages. This will impact both how C programs are written and how they are maintained and evolved. The proposed work also explored behavior-enhancing program transformations that can fix security vulnerabilities in C programs. The work on behavior-enhancing transformations should open a new paradigm of power tools that can be made available to programmers in general (not limited to C programmers).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will foster the development of new algorithms and data structures needed to implement scalable, robust automated program transformation tools for C. It will focus on the parts of this problem that have been inadequately addressed in prior work - specifically, sound handling of the C preprocessor and deep program analysis. At the same time, the work will address the heterogeneity of C platforms, e.g., different dialects, different configurations based on underlying hardware, different IDEs, etc. The Principle Investigator led an NSF-supported research effort to address the research problems in the last three years and has developed a large research prototype (over 500 KLOC). The proposed work brings many of the research results to practice.

The results from these tools will enable the developers to take actionable steps to improve and evolve their applications before releasing to customers. This process will also increase developers' confidence in the reliability of their app and will allow them to ship high-quality apps faster. As a result, the average mobile user will have a better mobile experience, thus benefiting all segments of society that rely on mobile computing for their daily activities. From a research perspective, the proposed project will help us understand the practical issues in effectively applying and scaling test generation for mobile applications. Based on the findings, the company will define improved techniques to address such issues and disseminate its results broadly through publications and interactions with industry. Finally, the work will positively influence the next generation of mobile computing development tools by making automated testing more integrated with the development process.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project directly addresses the stated goals of the "Information Technologies" topic; it promises to provide fundamental scientific advances by developing both solid theoretical foundations and practical tools that help in improving the functionality and performance of mobile software. Bugs in mobile applications are dependent on the multiple contexts such as user, location, platform etc., leading to several challenges in testing under realistic user conditions. Thus, despite recent research advances in software engineering, app testing is still done by humans, resulting in a tedious and error prone process. This project will lead to the development of novel techniques and a tool (product) that enables, supports and automates the generation of test cases for mobile applications under various conditions. Upon completion, this project will provide unprecedented advantages to developers for reducing their testing costs while effectively finding and addressing app issues. The results of the company's preliminary evaluation are encouraging and motivate further research and development in this area. The company will leverage relationships built during its initial customer discovery to empirically validate the proposed techniques on real world mobile applications.

    This SBIR Phase I Project explores the approach of teaching fundamental engineering concepts through engaging gameplay using a proprietary platform. The platform consists of tiles that can be put together in different ways in 3 dimensions, acting as an input to a game. The game is implemented on a paired device that can be on a tablet or a computer. The player will be presented increasingly difficult challenges and puzzles within game, and will have to use the physical tiles to assist in constructing the solution. The field of engineering exists in 3 dimensions, and the proposed project aims to explore building the intuition of this field within our youngest learners. The broader impact is in the vision for the platform to exist as a means to introduce different STEM topics in a fun and engaging manner, creating fond memories that could lead to more children with an interest in pursuing STEM related fields in the future. The project also has a mission to remain gender neutral in its design, so as to provide games that foster interest in both girls and boys.

    This SBIR Phase I Project will explore, through the use of near field communications, the extension of a proprietary platform that can read and construct data in 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. There is a given theoretical limit to which near field communications are viable, and this project will explore optimizations and additions to the current proprietary solution to achieve a communications distance closer to the theoretical limit. The proprietary system is highly compact, and the project will be researching ways to prevent self interference while improving the range of the system. The main explorations include a look at optimizing off-the-shelf near field communications inlay designs, optimizing the current antenna design and network, and the potential addition of a signal amplifier to boost the range of the system.

    Transfer (STTR) project will be to transform the current models for bone marrow-
    and cord blood-derived cell therapies and make cell therapy, especially the patients'
    own cells, more widely available for use by healthcare providers and patients.
    Two major technical hurdles in the regenerative medicine field have prevented
    the translation of cell therapy from the bench to the bedside, despite the huge
    surge in clinical trials being conducted worldwide: 1) The lack of devices for
    the isolation of native clinically active bone marrow or cord blood derived cells
    without gradient selection and centrifugation that lead to cell loss and decreased
    cell viability; and 2) The logistical hurdles of cell isolation and processing
    in \"centralized\" cell production facilities. The prevalent approaches involve
    the collection of patient tissues such as bone marrow samples at hospitals, transport
    of samples to the central cell production facilities, isolation and expansion
    of cells using different protocols, and transporting the cell product back to
    the hospital sites for transplantation into patients. Every step of this cell
    therapy and transplantation process is expensive, involves multiple teams and
    poses a potential risk for introducing contamination, cellular loss and other
    complications. The technology proposed in this project is incorporated in a device
    that has the potential to overcome these two hurdles. The device allows the derivation
    of adherent bone marrow cells (ABMCs) that are native or minimally manipulated,
    in a GMP-compliant process for isolation and delivery of cells for cell therapy
    applications in hospitals and outpatient clinics, thereby circumventing transportation
    requirement and central facility processing and making cell therapy more widely
    available. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to overcome the hurdles in the
    regenerative medicine field by developing a device that enables GMP-grade stem
    cell processing in a functionally closed system. This project will validate GMP-grade
    isolation of the fraction of the bone marrow, the adherent bone marrow cells (ABMCs)
    for use in cell therapy applications, initially for spinal cord injuries. While
    the ultimate goal is to conduct IND enabling studies, this Phase I grant objectives
    covers: 1) GMP-compliant coating of the device surface with matrix molecules and
    validation for efficient collection of ABMCs, 2) Post processing validation of
    ABMC sample integrity. Since the device also has a provision component for freezing
    of the processed samples, objective 3) is to validate ABMC freezing and cell recovery.
    Safety assays will include sterility and end product monitoring. Non-retrospective
    flow cytometry assays will be utilized to analyze CD34, CD44, CD45, CD73, CD90,
    CD105, CD106, CD166, and CD271 expression, essential markers that distinguish
    ABMCs. Higher percentages of CD106 and CD271 are expected for ABMCs. The potential
    for CFU-F formation, along with adipogenic, osteogenic and neuronal potentials
    of ABMCs will be examined and compared with standard mesenchymal stem cells. The
    collection of bone marrow cells with superior regenerative potentials, as indicated
    with previous pilot studies, is anticipated."

    The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is the development of a low-cost process to mitigating nitrate, a ubiquitous pollutant that is steadily eroding the quality and availability of safe potable water all around the world. This novel process combines and sequences electrochemistry, aqueous chemical reactions, solid oxide formation and surface adsorption processes into a simple continuous-flow unit to achieve high levels of nitrate removal; optimization will be guided by computational techniques that lend themselves to discovery of new materials that may also demonstrate breakthrough potential for other critical fields such as fuel treatment and large scale energy storage. The project offers an opportunity to apply interdisciplinary solutions to complex societal problems and will yield a self-contained unit, inexpensive to build and operate, scalable, modular and reliable.

    The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to develop an inexpensive water treatment module for selective removal of nitrate from aqueous media. The module employs a novel sequence of electrochemically controlled processes to promote in situ formation and ripening of metal hydrous oxide crystals, with documented adsorptive effectiveness, readily separating them from continuously flowing water. The primary objectives of this project are refining and addressing the high risk aspects of this methodology, merging field experience with concepts from published papers, sequencing processes and regulating conditions in novel ways, enhancing adsorption properties while mitigating interferences by oxyanions.  The technology will advance understanding of metal hydrous oxides and the kinetics of their formation, which may well inform creation of other inexpensive processes for simultaneous removal of multiple problematic pollutants, potentially recovering them for commercial re-use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the improvement in the quality of life for older adults currently affected by falls. Every year over 700,000 older adults are hospitalized in the United States due to fall-related injuries, which result in $34B in direct medical costs. The proposed technology will reduce first and future falls by providing an older adult's medical treatment team (e.g., physician, physical therapist, etc.) with fall history and ambulatory information.  Fall histories are difficult to obtain and unreliable (as many occurrences are not self-reported). The underlying technological development can be further expanded to allow smart buildings to behave as "first responders" and aid their occupants during man-made and natural disasters. Extensions of this technology have potential in many fields, including efficient energy management systems, security and threat detection, emergency response and evacuation, and structural health monitoring. The proposed technology respects privacy while enabling significant improvement in infrastructure intelligence.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a state-of-the-art lifestyle-monitoring system for older adults in assisted homes that has a comprehensive approach towards fall prevention and detection. The healthcare industry has invested significant resources in predicting falls based on the number of previous falls, but current healthcare professional's access to individual patient fall history is limited due to unreliable self-reporting. Additionally, research has shown that the risk of future falls can be greatly reduced through timely preventative treatments. This prevention is achieved by indirectly monitoring the physical activity and falls of older adults through floor-mounted accelerometers coupled with data analytics processing. This analysis studies inherent patterns in recorded data of events such as falls, walking, door slams, etc. Prediction is made possible through the recording of the unreported falls and health history. The anticipated output of this system is a means of detecting falls, locating them, and effective historical data storage, which will result in a more accurate future risk evaluation of the older adult.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in the field of radiation therapy (RT) for head & neck cancer patients. RT planning involves designing a radiation treatment regimen so that tumors are irradiated to definitive doses while minimizing irradiation to normal structures. For devising an optimal RT plan, target tumors and critical anatomic structures need to be accurately contoured on medical images. In current clinical practice, organ contour delineation is performed mostly manually due to lack of automated contouring software. This makes RT planning error prone, hampers throughput, and does not allow re-contouring to handle changes taking place during RT. Such changes can cause under dosing to tumor and overdosing to normal surrounding organs. In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have RT. Given that there are over 2,100 RT centers in the US, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing an auto-contouring software system. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved speed, throughput, and accuracy of contouring compared to current clinical practice, and improved patient outcomes and cost-savings.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses a technical hurdle related to auto-contouring in RT planning for cancer patients. Current technical challenges for auto-contouring occur since available contouring methods have been developed mostly for a specific object on images of a particular modality. This project will overcome these hurdles through a novel automatic anatomy recognition methodology which will employ anatomy models derived from patient populations by including all major objects in a body region. The models will codify the rich object anatomic relationship, and will exploit this information to automatically locate and contour objects in any given patient image. The project will have two aims. Aim 1 involves the development of the method and prototype software for contouring major head & neck organs on CT and PET/CT images. Models will be built from already existing image and contour data of 200 cancer patients. Aim 1 outcome will be prototype software technically validated to be accurate within 1 pixel boundary distance compared to ground truth and requiring 3 minutes or less per study. Aim 2 will be a preliminary clinical assessment of the software in RT planning in patients with head & neck malignancies.

    This STTR Phase I project will carry out research and development on a cloud-based pluggable data analytics engine to address the educational game market?s need of real-time assessment for learning.  Educational games will become much more successful if learning from games can be well quantified so that buyers will be assured that the time spent using games is productive. However, currently game makers are not qualified or funded to provide the statistics and cognitive assessment required for such analysis. This project will thus build a prototype of commercial pluggable third-party engine that traces the growth of the learner's knowledge in real time without interference and provides customized assessment summary and feedback to educational stakeholders. The prototype will be developed and tested with games that teach data literacy in three high schools representing diverse demographic groups. The testing in a commercial environment will begin in collaboration with two successful educational game companies. The innovative use of data-intensive assessment technology will aid in currently struggling STEM education in the United States by providing streamlined and accurate information while learning occurs. This project will also help launch a new business that has potential to boost the market value of educational games and digital learning.

    This STTR Phase I project utilizes the Monte-Carlo Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (MC-BKT) algorithm. This algorithm was recently developed in-house based on techniques distilled through years of research in physics, education, and computation, and makes it possible to perform individualized knowledge tracing in real-time for the first time. In prior research, post hoc MC-BKT analysis led to identification of up to seven distinct patterns associated with knowledge growth during game segments, with 84% accuracy as compared with human judgments based on video analysis of game screens and players' discourse. This project will conduct research to test whether this assessment potential of the MC-BKT algorithm can be extended beyond initial research to players with games involving different content domains, in a greater number of classrooms with diverse demographics (involving around 600 high school students), and in real time. Based on research results, this project will build a prototype commercial product around the MC-BKT algorithm in the form of a cloud-based pluggable engine. Two popular commercial educational games as well as various games internally sourced within this project will be test-connected to the engine for real-time testing of knowledge tracing, learning problem detection, and feedback delivery to teachers, parents, game designers, and learners.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a high throughput, imagery-based single cell analysis system.  The system will be used to characterize high cell density polymicrobial samples captured during biological research.  Initially, the technology will be applied to the problem of quantifying extremely low levels of microbial contamination in biological samples.  The quantification and control of microbial contamination is an important challenge in industrial fermentation and in the manufacturing of biologics.  Methods for rapid and sensitive detection of microbial contaminants do not exist.  Traditional contamination detection methods involve time-consuming culturing of cells or manual and imprecise checks with a microscope.  The proposed technology will provide automated and rapid sample characterization, allowing a speed of analysis that is 1000 times faster than current systems.  This increased throughput will additionally allow lower levels of contamination to be quantified.  While initially applied to research, the technology can also be used as an analytical and diagnostic tool in the medical field.  For example, this analysis system could be used to search for malformed red blood cells in a human sample that might arise due to a disease like sickle cell anemia, or to determine the relative abundance and morphology of immune cells, an analysis that would help identify certain leukemias.

    This project will create a hardware platform and a parallelized computer vision system that is capable of fully characterizing each cell in a 1mL biological sample in under five minutes.  To analyze samples taken from a fermentation process with high cell densities requires the micrography system to be capable of processing over one billion cells in the analysis window.  The project aims to develop four subsystems: a high pressure microfluidic system for separating and isolating cells, an imaging system, a set of high throughput algorithms to classify the cellular imagery data and a horizontally-scalable computing platform on which to run the classifying code.  The project will begin by developing a low throughput, fully functioning prototype.  The efforts will then focus on developing the four primary subsystems in parallel, using knowledge gained in the prototyping efforts to guide the later work.  Additional phases will focus on the integration of high throughput versions of the subsystems.  The fully realized single cell micrography system will represent a leap forward in speed and specificity compared to traditional cytometry systems.  With no manual intervention and in an open-ended, label-free manner, researchers will be able to conduct parts per billion-level inspection of a biological sample.

    development of intelligent and sustainable coating technology to present a game
    changing option to the corrosion protection coating industry. The annual global
    cost of corrosion is estimated to be US$2.5 trillion while USA alone has to lose
    more than $1 trillion. The global anticorrosion coating market has been valued
    for more than US$14 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach beyond US$26 billion
    in 2022. Apart from inferior performance, currently available corrosion prevention
    coatings pose significant threat to the environment and human health. It is very
    hard for the poor and developing countries to bear the related costs. Development
    of this multifunctional coating will afford them a safer alternative for protecting
    their assets. In preliminary experiments, this coating innovation has shown significant
    potential in preventing corrosion and biofouling activity on the treated surface.
    The thermal analysis and nanomechanical analysis have indicated that these coatings
    have exceptionally high thermal and mechanical stability approaching that of ceramic
    materials. Based on the preliminary data, it is safe to state that these coatings
    present a breakthrough in the area of surface protection through barrier coatings.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project includes the development of user friendly
    multifunctional coating for wide variety of substrates. Historically, chromate
    conversion coatings (CCC) have been extensively used in preventing metals from
    corroding. However, there are serious concerns over the use of CCC as it poses
    human health risks. Carcinogenic hexavalent chromium ions used in coating technology
    for the corrosion protection of metals are being phased out by Environmental Protection
    Agency in USA and Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restrictions of Chemicals
    regulation in Europe. The key innovation of this project is the development of
    a liquid precursor to a transparent strong ceramic-like coating that can protect
    substrates from harsh environmental conditions. This ready to use thin coating,
    suitable for application in the automobile and aerospace industries, adheres strongly
    to most substrates, adds minimal weight and can be transparent or pigmented. Besides
    corrosion protection, the coating can also provide scratch resistance, oleophobicity,
    and possibly anti-microbial properties to numerous surfaces."

    non-invasive device, a breathalyzer, will measure the level of ammonia in exhaled
    breath.  High ammonia levels are associated with conditions such as advanced liver
    disease, urea cycle disorders (UCD), or adverse reactions to medication.  It has
    serious consequences: disorientation, organ/brain damage, coma and even death,
    making it important to take steps to quickly reduce systemic ammonia and, if the

    are determined through blood testing, which is invasive, takes time, requires
    a lab/hospital visit, and is prone to errors.  There are no tools available to
    accurately measure ammonia, real time.  The device will enable patients and families
    to take control and make better decisions: what to eat, when not to drive, when
    to go to the hospital, among other things.  This can improve productivity, enhance
    quality of life for patients and their families, avoid unnecessary healthcare

    technology that creates a porous nanostructure metal oxides grains layer, and
    is able to provide results with a fast response time at a low cost. This results
    from the ability to easily and inexpensively produce different morphologies of
    materials from the vapor phase in the open atmosphere in a one-step process. The
    end-product of this project will be a prototype utilizing a single sensor for

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create an economical, high performance Terahertz (THz) spectrometer mounted to a consumer drone or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to allow testing of air for the presence of harmful compounds over a specific geographical location. A frequency domain THz spectrometer is capable of characterizing many different molecules and chemicals in a gas sample. Historically these spectrometers have been relegated to the laboratory because of their size and complexity. However, recent advancements have made it possible to build a lightweight spectrometer that can be mounted to a drone. This is significant because the ability to analyze samples locally removes the time and expense of collecting and shipping potentially dangerous compounds (i.e. chemical warfare agents or pollutants) to a laboratory for analysis. It also allows detection and classification to occur on short notice and without the need to subject personnel to the local environment. The THz Drone will allow immediate and accurate detection of many harmful compounds in the air.

    The proposed project will demonstrate a compact, battery operated, frequency domain THz photomixing spectrometer that is capable of Doppler limited molecular spectroscopy and is constructed predominantly from economical off-the-shelf fiber optic components in a highly compact, light-weight form factor. The brass-board instrument will incorporate an optical phase-modulation technique to remove the effects of coherent detection and it will have a greater than 2 THz bandwidth with a spectral purity of better than 100 kHz. After construction, the instrument will be employed to measure Doppler limited molecular transitions of carbon dioxide mixed with water vapor. Upon the successful demonstration of the capabilities of the instrument, a first-draft design for an integrated system weighing less than 3 kg and capable of being carried with a consumer drone will be generated as will a larger laboratory version of the instrument.

- abstractText: "This SBIR phase I project will provide a unique computational capability
    to additive manufacturing (AM) designers, engineers, and technicians for making
    better decisions with regards to metal 3D printing. Through AM, one can fabricate
    complex parts that were previously impossible to manufacture. Perfecting an AM
    process is however non-trivial, entailing time-consuming and expensive shop-floor
    experimentation. For example, fabricating a typical hand-sized component on a
    metal AM machine can take several hours to complete, costing thousands of dollars.
    Consequently, there is significant interest today to replace experiments with
    computer simulation. But AM simulations today require massively parallel computer
    clusters, such as those available only at national labs. This has largely deterred
    industrial progress and innovation. The proposed research has the potential to
    yield an algorithmically  advanced AM simulation program that can run on standard
    desktop workstations without loss of accuracy. An environmental impact of this
    SBIR proposal is that by promoting virtual simulation of AM, the amount of wasted
    material will be minimized. \n\nThe proposed research lies at the intersection
    of computational mechanics, and manufacturing. It proposes to develop a novel
    computational approach to additive manufacturing simulation that bypasses the
    memory bottleneck observed in traditional finite element analysis (FEA). By using
    a voxel representation where all elements are congruent (i.e. possess a rigid
    transformation symmetry) and have identical material properties, the memory requirements
    can be reduced dramatically and thereby speed up the simulation by orders of magnitude
    compared to traditional FEA software. Similar approach has been successfully demonstrated
    for problems in structural mechanics and topology optimization. The proposal aims
    to extend the approach to in-process AM simulation where G-code will be used to
    identify elements in a heat affected zone for laser and electron beam based processes,
    and the congruent elements will be identified for each phase in the process to
    reduce simulation time."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide accurate indoor location services to users via existing mobile electronic devices like smartphones, tablets and laptops. This technology will bring many of the applications powered by satellite-based positioning systems like navigation, tracking and location-based advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-meter location accuracy within large GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive AC wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail and manufacturing all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.

    The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost RF tags to better than 1 meter of accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to scale this localization technology so that it can support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of scalable multiple access protocols for ultrasound communication, networking protocols for synchronization and data collection, inertial sensor fusion algorithms for robust and accurate localization and APIs for app integration by third parties.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to develop an analysis software package to significantly reduce health care costs while simultaneously improving patient care by helping select the correct treatment for each patient. Every year an estimated of 1.4 million women undergo unnecessary treatments at a cost to society of $32.2 billion for breast cancer. At the same time, some patients do not receive the treatment they need. For instance, chemotherapy is not routinely recommended after surgical tumor removal for patients with early stage lung cancer, even though the disease will recur in a large number of them. The ability to correctly identify disease subtypes and patient subgroups is a pre-condition to the ability to distinguish between patients that need the most aggressive treatments, and those who will never progress or recur. Further, the proposed approach can improve the results of clinical trials. With an estimated 2,300 Phase III clinical trials per year in the US, a full 50% of them are destined for failure with a loss of $1 billion/year. This can be avoided if the correct inclusion criteria are defined, and the drug is administered only to the people most likely to respond.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel software package able to identify subtypes of disease based on the integration of multiple types of omics data. Many drug candidates fail and many patients receive inappropriate treatment because of the current inability to distinguish between subgroups of patients and/or subtypes of disease. Many attempts to achieve this based solely on gene expression signatures have been undertaken but yielded only modest success so far. In addition, very few approaches are able to combine multiple data types and most of the time the analysis of each data type leads to different subgroups that are very hard to interpret. The technology proposed here will be able to discover clinically relevant disease subtypes by integrating multiple types of high-throughput data such as mRNAs, miRNAs, methylation, etc. The goal of this project is to implement this technology as a software package that will facilitate its application in large scale consistent with real-world use. In addition, the plan is to assess the feasibility of this technology by performing an extensive comparison with the top three existing approaches:  Consensus clustering, similarity network fusion, and iClusterPlus using over 1,800 real patient data from 12 different studies.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this project will be to create a depth vision system that accelerates
    the transition to intelligent automation. The intelligent automation movement is driven by the opportunity
    to increase human productivity, and it can be seen in all domains: from Siemen?s self-organizing
    manufacturing plants to Amazon?s proposed delivery drones. This project aims to improve robotic vision,
    which is currently a limitation to greater autonomy. The research uses innovations in semiconductor
    physics to create time-of-flight depth cameras that reach new levels of spatial resolution and fidelity. These
    cameras, in conjunction with rapidly evolving software that uses depth data to model the physical world,
    give robotic systems the human-like abilities they need to perform more complicated tasks in dynamic
    environments. Robotics will become increasingly effective at the navigation, material handling, and object
    manipulation tasks that are the basis of so many manufacturing and logistics processes. The project
    outcomes will advance the state-of-the-art in depth vision technology, and provide a prototype camera that
    can be used to test a variety of challenging object recognition tasks.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses an important limitation in depth
    cameras that use the phase delay time-of-flight (TOF) method. Existing TOF cameras use ?pixel-level
    demodulation?: specially designed photodetector arrays where each pixel performs both light detection and
    demodulation. This design limits the modulation frequency, and thus depth accuracy, because the high
    frequency signals create excessive noise and parasitic capacitances. The authors propose an alternative
    ?optical demodulation? design wherein light is demodulated by a single fast optical shutter, and then
    collected by a separate conventional image sensor. By separating light modulation from light detection,
    parasitic capacitances are eliminated and it is possible to reach high frequencies with acceptable power
    consumption and noise. The research program will develop new optical shutters that demonstrate these
    characteristics, and integrate the shutters into a functioning prototype depth camera. Success will show that
    TOF cameras can be produced with substantially higher spatial resolution and design flexibility.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is the development of technology for use of sulfide mining
    waste streams as a novel energy source for the production of chemicals from CO2.
    Sulfide mining wastes pose a serious, perpetual environmental risk, and are continuously
    generated as by-products of mining operations. The sulfide minerals in mining
    waste also are viable energy source for a diverse community of microbes that derive
    their energy from the oxidation of these minerals. This biological oxidation releases
    significant amounts of energy from the rock. The energy released from one ton
    of sulfide mining waste is approximately equivalent to one barrel of oil. Approximately
    95% of copper ores are found in sulfide-rich ore deposits and at about 20 million
    metric tons annually, constitute ~15% of mining waste (representing millions of
    barrels of oil).  From genetically engineered microbes, it is proposed to use
    this energy to generate chemicals from CO2. As such, sulfide waste streams represent
    a new high energy feedstock for the sustainable production of chemicals from CO2.
    This technology will improve the sustainability of mining and provide a non-agricultural,
    non-photosynthetic and economically attractive route to carbon-neutral chemicals.\n
    \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the development of genetically
    modified A. ferrooxidans for the utilization of mining process waste streams as
    a feedstock for biotechnology applications. Readily available sulfur-rich waste
    streams produced during the traditional smelting processing of copper contain
    about 40% per metric ton of the energy of glucose, and about 20 million metric
    tons are produced annually in the U.S. These energy intensive waste streams are
    currently landfilled, and their environmental oxidation can lead to acid mine
    drainage. To leverage this opportunity, the ability to rationally engineer this
    species to produce isobutyric acid from atmospheric CO2 has been developed. The
    specific aims of this proposal are: 1) develop model reactor systems to characterize
    performance and operations using actual mine tailing feedstocks; 2) improve biological
    productivity through further metabolic engineering of A. ferrooxidans; and 3)
    develop a sophisticated techno-economic analysis of the novel bioprocess. In addition,
    a commitment from a mining company for access to a tailing feedstock supply and
    a site to construct and operate a pilot-scale plant will be secured. Accomplishing
    these goals will prepare for a future follow-on Phase II proposal to scale-up
    our technology, further characterize performance on actual process streams, and
    demonstrate large-scale process feasibility."

    This project will develop an immersive and dynamic multi-player game that addresses a pressing need to provide engaging technologies that prepare students to apply collaborative, cross-disciplinary scientific practices to global societal challenges. In an augmented classroom with their real life peers, students must establish a colony on Mars that is capable of sustaining thousands of refugees from Earth. To successfully achieve their goal, students must use raw materials found on Mars to produce components necessary for life support and building, such as food, water, oxygen, and fuel. In the weeks that this simulation runs alongside their real classroom, students will apply cross-disciplinary STEM knowledge and practices to experience how both individual and collective actions have short- and long-term effects. The game and supporting curriculum will address content from the Next Generation Science Standards and ultimately help adolescent youth understand the need for the integration of science and engineering to tackle critical issues such as the production of clean energy, identification and treatment of disease, the allocation of adequate food and water, and global environmental change (NRC, 2011). Creating educational games that more closely mirror their AAA counterparts provides an opportunity to draw diverse genders and underrepresented youth into STEM-related fields.


    This project?' goal is to create "virtual field trips" that augment a classroom and run simultaneous to it, providing applications and experiential learning in a highly engaging social environment. It will build upon previous proprietary technology that enables simultaneous online interactions, complex distributed simulations, and data gathering in shared virtual worlds. This allows the project in its initial phase to focus not only on developing a quality game for students but also on designing and testing high-risk approaches to classroom integration. This game includes the teacher and suggests actions that alter narrative arcs, provide students with key knowledge, or increase or constrain other material resources students have available. Teachers will be able to leverage data collected on student game play to pair small, dynamic groupings of students with high impact mini-lessons to allow the project to actively support teachers as they implement personalized, data-driven instruction. By including a teacher-friendly assessment toolkit, the project can operate within districts' current requirements while experimenting with the future of educational gaming in the classroom. Phase I research will focus on usability and impact on student learning, as well as attempt to understand how willing teachers are to accept and use the teacher support features.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring to market a novel power chip architecture for battery-operated electronics, such as smartphones, wearable electronics, electric vehicles, blade servers, cloud-infrastructure hardware, telecom devices, tablets, routers, LED lightning, etc. There are four critical requirements of the power management integrated circuits (PMIC) when used in mobile devices: (1) high energy efficiency for a longer battery run-time between charges; (2) small solution size by freeing up extremely limited space for new functionalities; (3) fast response speed for wide variety of uses; and (4) simplified circuit design for shortening new products' time-to-market. Currently, no solutions are capable of simultaneously meeting the above four requirements. It has become necessary to consider a new topology that could help enabling more efficient Internet of Things designs. It is therefore an object of this proposal to develop novel power chips where the above four requirements can be easily met. Consequently, for any direct current powered mobile devices, as long as they are consuming large power, struggling with limited spaces, and requiring efficient cooling effects, the proposed solution aims to achieve the optimal performance.

    Unlike the present power management integrated chip (PMIC) solutions that have to lose one or more features for a certain improvement, the proposed intellectual merits achieve all of the important features in one single architecture without losing anything. The new PMIC architecture has been preliminarily verified using computer modeling simulation based on ideal circuit models. The objective of this project is to develop new power management chips for use in smartphones and to achieve optimal testing results when verified with 180 nanometer CMOS processes. The R&D scope includes intellectual property core block circuits design, reusable sub-module testing, and mixed signal top-level simulations where the combination of all blocks and modules will be thoroughly represented, within which a circuit that will be etched onto the wafer in Phase II must function correctly. This work?s goal is to demonstrate that the proposed PMIC architecture is a valid solution to fundamentally address the major pain points in the mobile device market.

    evidence shows that vaccines are effective in preventing infectious diseases such
    as influenza, a contagious respiratory illness. However, despite CDC's recommendation
    for universal influenza vaccination, fewer than 50% of all children in the US,
    and only 1 in 3 of African-American children, are vaccinated each year. The proposed
    activities are designed to educate kids and parents about the benefits of vaccinations,
    in order to increase the number of vaccinated children. Through a tag game and
    wearable devices, participants simulate transmission of influenza, and thereby
    better visualize the health risks of going unvaccinated. The long-term goal is
    to improve the health literacy of young students in a fun and exciting way. Educating
    children about health concepts promotes healthy behaviors, and leads families
    toward better health-related decisions. Improving health literacy, especially
    in a technology-oriented society, is key to developing a thriving population that
    can understand and use new information. The commercial outcome of the proposed
    SBIR project will lead to a marketable product that will be targeted toward hands-on

    such phenomena. The system uses smartwatches for managing tag games that educate
    children about the benefits of vaccination against influenza. Each participant
    is assigned a health status, such as infectious, healthy, or immune, and then
    runs around to simulate the spread of the flu. Through these participation-based
    activities, students will develop better understandings of the underlying concepts
    of infectious disease transmission, community-level (herd) immunity, and disease
    outbreaks. Similar activities can be used to teach other scientific phenomena
    such as chemical reactions and phase changes. The project will evaluate the effectiveness
    of activities using systematic surveys producing feedback from participants. This
    work fills a market need for educational technology tools that provide powerful
    and memorable learning experiences that not only improve health literacy but also
    foster student interest and confidence in science and math. Educating children
    by exposing them to the sciences, especially in health-related areas, is essential
    to improving wellbeing, and aligns with NSF?s mission of promoting science education."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to make solar generation more efficient and more affordable.  Consequently, it promotes a safer and greener environment.  The proposed approach is novel and has the potential to revolutionize solar generation.  Therefore, it gives the U.S. a technological and commercial competitive edge in the global renewable energy market.  Also, this project will expose interns to discovery-based exercises and will train them to work on the design and development of solar PV energy systems.  In an attempt to diversify the workforce in the solar energy market, students from minority and underrepresented groups will be encouraged to engage in the research activities of this project.  This project also fosters potential research collaborations and communications between small businesses, universities, and research institutions.  Consequently, the project will enhance infrastructure for research and education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes using GaN devices in string solar inverters.  The innovative aspect of this work is threefold.  i) Wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductor devices will be used in this effort.  ii) The proposed circuit topology is a novel inverter which utilizes coupled inductors to cancel the current ripples induced on the input and output sides of the converter.  iii) The proposed inverter acts as a synthetic frequency response reserve to improve the frequency stability of its local grid.  The proposed circuit topology is creative and allows for significant reduction in the size of the filtering elements.  Hence, the overall weight, volume, and cost of this solar inverter are lower than its predecessors.

    Research (SBIR) project is to revolutionize the US solar cell market with low-cost
    and high-efficiency solar cells. The development of cost-effective and efficient
    solar power technologies is of national interest because solar power has broad
    potential to support US priorities such as economic growth and job creation, as
    well as mitigation of climate change. However, the cost of solar energy is still
    high, and technological innovations are needed to further lower costs and increase
    efficiency. The efficiency of perovskite solar cells has surged to over 22% in
    five years of research and now rivals that of CdTe and Si-based solar panels.
    Perovskite inks are made from Earth-abundant, inexpensive precursors and can be
    printed on plastic foils, which can significantly reduce their manufacturing and
    installation costs. However, before commercialization of this technology can be
    considered, device stability and the feasibility of reliable, scalable manufacturing
    of large-area panels have to be established. This project will bridge this critical
    knowledge gap and develop manufacturing technology that can compete in terms of
    cost and performance not only with other solar panels but also with conventional
    fossil fuel-based energy sources. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop
    scalable, reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective technology to manufacture
    perovskite photovoltaic devices using an industry-proven slot die coating technique.
    Most research lab perovskite solar cell devices are fabricated via spin casting,
    and have a device area of less 1 sq. cm. Despite the impressive progress of this
    technology, its commercially viable scalability and reliability have not yet been
    demonstrated. In this project, slot-die coating will be used, which is a proven
    technology to be scalable for large area processing and robust for high-yield
    manufacturing in a wide range of applications. We will use the slot die coating
    method and air stable p-i-n devices architecture to manufacture perovskite solar
    panel with a target power conversion efficiency of 20%, operational lifetime of
    more than 10,000 hours, power-to-weight ratio of 1 kW/kg, and target manufacturing
    cost of less than $0.3/W, which is more than a 40% reduction in costs when compared
    to industry leading photovoltaic technologies."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make uniformly high quality practice by Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) accessible to non-ambulatory and underserved rural populations. Because the inability to engage in spoken communication is among the most debilitating of all human conditions, poor access to high quality speech-language pathology services is an important societal issue. It creates significant health disparities affecting not only the quality of peoples' lives but also the economics of their communities. Because speech-language pathology treatment is highly behavioral and intensive, any proposed solution must improve both the performance and productivity of individual SLPs. To provide the necessary scalability required for a nation-wide problem, any implementation must include networked mobile tools as well as a strong algorithmic foundation that automatically generates objective, reliable, and sensitive outcome measures. The project has the potential for significant commercial impact. There are currently 160K SLPs in the US and that number expected to exceed 240K by 2024. Following a software-as-a-service model where clinicians freely download software to their mobile device but need active a subscription to access outcome ratings, projects to a total clinical market of between $20M and $100M.

    The proposed project addresses the strong demand for the development of dependent objective measures of pathological speech that exists in a variety of clinical settings. Currently, perceptual (subjective) ratings of speech conducted by clinicians are the gold standard for evaluating speech improvement or decline. While it is acknowledged that subjective ratings have poor validity and reliability, objective measures have not been readily available. This project takes a novel intellectual approach to the problem by building machine-learning algorithms that objectively model experts' subjective ratings, but with levels of reliability that far exceed that of clinicians. The computational engine takes as an input a set of speech samples from a speaker and automatically evaluates the speech along clinically-standard perceptual dimensions. This yields outputs that are immediately clinical interpretable, thereby exceeding the value of norm-based objective outcomes. The project goals are, (i) to refine and extend existing technology for the evaluation of pathological speech; and (ii) to rigorously evaluate its performance and utility using beta testing. Statistical analyses will determine whether the model outperforms the human ratings with respect to reliability and sensitivity, as has been the case in pilot tests.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of the Small Business technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a bioreactor that may be used for production and expansion of cells for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and drug discovery.  While significant advances have been made in developing strategies for the culture and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, there is a critical gap in scaling these processes up to the number of cells required for clinical and research applications.  The specific focus of this project is the scale-up of beta islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. Diabetes currently affects 400 million people worldwide leading to 5 million deaths a year. There is currently no cure. A source of transplantable islet cells could alleviate many diabetic complications and restore the quality of life for millions of individuals.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel wicking bioreactor and bioprocess for expansion of human pluripotent-derived beta islet cells. More specifically, this will require focusing on 3 major objectives:  i)Optimizing the cellulosic surface of the wicking matrix with chemical and extra cellular matrix additions to ensure attachment and proliferation of the islet cells; ii)optimizing controlled differentiation parameters such as oxygenation levels and feed rates to achieve a 10 fold increase in differentiated cells; and iii) develop a process using physical and biochemical means to remove the differentiated cells from the matrix while maintaining cellular integrity both in terms of viability and phenotype.  These studies will serve as proof-of-principle of the proposed bioreactor for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to make video searchable and discoverable in a cost-effective manner by automating video annotation tasks that are currently done manually. Video is being created at an increasingly high rate, and media companies are becoming overwhelmed by the sheer amount of video in their libraries.  Companies have resorted to paying people to manually watch their videos and "tag" them with relevant descriptions so that the content becomes searchable and therefore useable.  In this project the company will build an inference engine that can leverage the data and structure within video to discover specific multimodal concepts significant to the particular domain and automatically train and refine classifiers to apply unique and meaningful data describing the video.  Leveraging this metadata, companies can index and search their videos more efficiently, enabling them to generate tailored video clips to meet specific goals, and ultimately publish video at a much larger scale.  The company believes the unique domain-specific video metadata generated by its system will have an overwhelming effect on the ability of companies to disseminate informative videos, and improve their use of video online.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project proposes to develop an inference engine that combines the modalities of information in video to automatically discover and train multimodal classifiers for important concepts within specific domains.  Current approaches to video understanding seek to develop general visual classification models; these approaches focus on leveraging labeled data to train supervised learning algorithms in order to describe the video. These approaches fail in specific verticals, because the information output is not granular enough to provide value within the context of the specific domain, and the cost for manual annotation is high. The approach proposed in this project takes into account the multimodal information associated with a group of related videos to automatically learn classifiers for concepts that are important in this video domain, without expensive manual annotation. The approach leverages the correlations between the different modalities in video and existing domain-specific structure to intelligently accomplish this task.  The company expects this research to lead to the discovery of many new domain-specific video concept classifiers that do not exist in current visual ontologies, and a reusable approach for training visual classifiers that can be applied across many domains.

    such as nanoparticles and microcapsules. While mechanical pumps are conventionally
    used to drive fluid flow, chemical \"pumps\" can also propel fluid by using chemical
    reaction networks to create gradients in chemical concentrations and fluid densities.
    Researchers in the NSF Center for Chemo-Mechanical Assembly (CCMA) are creating
    new transformative tools to enable unprecedented control over fluid flow and particle
    organization in confined environments. These precisely controlled fluid flows
    enable the design of self-powered, self-sustaining systems that organize particles
    and are capable of performing complex functions such as an autonomous nanoparticle
    system that detects a chemical source and collectively delivers a response chemical
    to it resulting in a vital analysis or creation of a novel structure. The CCMA
    team includes expertise in catalysis, synthetic chemistry, physical chemistry,
    fluid flow, and modeling. In addition to providing the chemistry community with
    new chemical reaction network tools, CCMA is also contributing to science and
    technology workforce development by training students in multidisciplinary experimental
    and modeling techniques. Through its industry affiliates program, CCMA is engaging
    industry in student training and technology transfer. Concurrent with the research,
    the team is launching a vigorous program of education and outreach to the public.
    This includes expanding undergraduate and graduate research opportunities for
    underrepresented groups in research-based careers. The team is also participating
    in several large-scale public outreach programs including public lectures, designing
    hands-on traveling exhibits, and teaming with museums and science centers. \n\nThrough
    collaborative research that combines innovative modeling and experimental studies,
    the NSF CCI Phase I: Center for Chemo-Mechanical Assembly (CCMA) is harnessing
    catalytic chemical reactions to introduce spatiotemporal chemical gradients that
    drive the flow of a surrounding fluid. This flow, in turn, enables the manipulation
    of the collective behavior of suspended particles to drive new modes of dynamic
    self-organization. The Center is developing novel approaches to cause directed
    transport of nano- and micron-scale materials, control particle organization in
    confined chambers, and establish new chemical routes for regulating non-equilibrium
    structure formation from particles in solution. These studies are providing the
    chemistry community with fundamentally new tools and knowledge, including new

    materials assembly in harsh environments; and small-scale factories that can operate
    autonomously to build microscale components for use in fine instrumentation and

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project lies in treating clinical and subclinical inattention
    within a few minutes, by simply listening to algorithmically-generated music.
    Failures of attention have dramatic clinical and non-clinical ramifications. In
    the non-clinical side, nearly 90% of people attest to wasting time in the workplace,
    and this reduced efficiency has an estimated $1 T economic impact in the US alone.
    At the clinical level, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the best-characterized
    attentional deficit, affects over 8M children in the US, with the leading solution
    being a near-epidemic growth of prescriptions stimulants. However, over 4 M American
    adults do not meet all the criteria to be diagnosed with ADHD (and therefore cannot
    be prescribed medication), and have no convenient alternatives for treatment.
    Brain.fm is a non-invasive auditory stimulation platform designed to treat inattention.
    It generates music designed specifically to stimulate attentional networks in
    our brain by exploiting the latest neuroscience concepts of how neurons entrain
    to stimulus rhythms. Our objective is for Brain.fm to become a validated, non-invasive
    therapeutic tool for Attention to help everyone who suffers from mind wandering,
    regardless of whether they meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD. \n\nThe proposed
    project is aimed at experimentally demonstrating generalizable changes in attention
    through auditory stimulation. For decades, neuroscientists have observed wave-like
    activity in the brain and related them to attentional states. The ability to change
    attentional states, via noninvasive brain stimulation, would be greatly desirable
    for everyday functioning as well as crucial for understanding how brain waves
    relate to behavior. The proposed project tests a novel auditory neuroscience-informed
    platform solution for delivering noninvasive brain stimulation through music.
    In addition to establishing a revolutionary method to enhance attention noninvasively
    by tuning brain waves through comprehensive behavioral and fMRI studies, we test
    the efficacy of this method to treat inattention, especially in adults with Attention
    Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Key outcomes of this project are: 1) non
    clinical (but Institutional Review Board-approved) studies that determine how
    this auditory therapy impacts attention on an adult ADHD prone population, 2)
    a deeper understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of attention and neuronal
    entrainment, and 3)optimization of our product by testing different versions of
    our algorithmically generated music on our existing customer base. Results are
    expected to show how purpose-built acoustic stimulation can support the neuronal
    oscillations underlying sustained attention, thus boosting productivity and well-being."

    in marked differences in impairment and responsiveness to motor therapy, there
    is even a greater need to personalize motor training in post-stroke patients.
    The commercial impact of the personalized e-rehabilitation system, which will

    of the upper extremity, it will largely improve patients' outcomes. For clinics,
    the system will increase revenues by increasing the number of visits per patient
    due to better outcomes and compliance, as well as the number of patients trained

    This STTR Phase I project is focused on improving the energy density, safety and ultra-low temperature capability of battery devices. Conventional batteries fall short of these critical requirements for next-generation electric vehicle technologies, which are necessary to reduce emissions and the nation?s reliance on fossil fuel imports. Although the eventual goal of the proposed technology is to enter automotive markets, it may have an equally strong impact for applications in other areas requiring energy storage at low-temperatures. For example, multiple efforts aim to enable high-atmosphere telecommunications to further global connectivity to the internet, particularly in remote locations of the globe in third world countries whose standard of living could be enhanced with greater communication and education. Further, the proposed chemistry could also potentially be useful in electrochemical deposition of difficult to plate metals such as titanium or silicon for use in the aerospace, medical or high tech industries, areas which will ensure the U.S. remains internationally competitive while increasing job opportunity and tax revenue from emerging technologies. It is also a priority of this STTR to coordinate with the partner research institution to providing training and internship opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented communities in this research work to further improve our national industry by training the next generation workforce to better be prepared for industry and higher-education.

    This project aims to develop a novel electrolyte chemistry for next generation energy storage devices which has potential to address these three critical areas (energy density, safety, wide temperature operation). While conventional electrolyte chemistry commonly uses solvent solutions which are typically liquid at room temperature, this project will explore the use of solvent solutions which are gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Preliminary work on this novel electrolyte chemistry has shown high performance at ultra-low temperatures, enabling many high-atmosphere and aerospace applications without need for additional thermal management and engineering. In addition, a reversible battery shut-down mechanism at high temperatures, inherent in the electrolyte chemistry, allow for strong mitigation of thermal runaway for improved battery safety. Finally, high potential for a substantial increase in energy density with use of next-generation electrode materials has been shown to be possible. The focus of this project will be to develop these novel electrolytes and demonstrate superior performance in a full cell device with application to the automotive industry and low-temperature markets. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and it is hoped these materials will lead to advances in next-generation energy storage devices and other technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

    to help integrate renewable energy sources.  This is critical as electricity generation
    and transportation consume about 2/3 of all US energy and emit more than 1/2 of

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to demonstrate a new way of integrating energy harvesting technologies in standard electronic circuits. This offers the opportunity to produce small sensors and devices in remote locations that can collect information, monitor conditions, and transmit data without the need to replace batteries. Small batteries are unsuitable for electronics that are remotely deployed, driving interest to harvest electrical energy directly from the movement and vibration of machinery. Currently, energy harvesting is too large, expensive, and inefficient for practical deployment. If energy harvesting can be made small and inexpensive, it can enable a large suite of products and services for industrial, civil, and agricultural remote monitoring. This project offers the potential to bring energy harvesting to electronics in a way that allows highly efficient energy conversion from vibrating or moving machinery, while maintaining small size and low cost. The ability to embed tiny moving parts directly within printed circuits is highly innovative, and dynamic energy harvesting is an excellent application of this technology. The patented manufacturing processes can be performed using domestic electronics manufacturing infrastructure helping to bring next-generation manufacturing to the U.S.

    The proposed project seeks to demonstrate a new way to embed dynamic energy harvesting devices directly within printed circuit boards, enabling micro energy production at low cost and small size. The project builds on patented manufacturing processes that leverages conventional electronics manufacturing infrastructure?devices can be built having feature sizes in microns without the need for expensive silicon fabrication foundries. The project will explore designs and fabrication processes for small, efficient vibrating units, culminating in the production of multiple devices in a single small footprint circuit board. Significant effort will be on the development of small, efficient vibrating units that can be manufactured cheaply and in large quantities, yet embedded directly within printed circuits. Three manufacturing rounds are anticipated, producing real devices that can be experimentally tested and measured. The successful completion of this project will demonstrate electrical energy production in a small printed circuit board (approximately the size of a credit card), targeting 100 microwatts to power sensing and telemetry electronics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is establishment of sustainable, cost-effective technology to mitigate local volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and other indoor air pollutants by using photocatalysts to effectively destroy them at their point of generation. VOC exposure is pervasive in many commercial environments, including nail salons, where employees work with materials that emit VOCs which can pose health risk without adequate protection. The proposed innovation addresses key gaps limiting the successful application of photocatalysts to these environments, specifically the need to eliminate by-products that may form during VOC destruction and the use of visible light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as alternatives to the harmful ultraviolet (UV) lights currently employed for photocatalysis. Novel photocatalytic materials will be applied to achieve safe, facile implementation at the point of exposure in commercial activities where employees are directly impacted. An improved understanding of the activity of innovative photocatalysts in the visible light range will enhance the overall understanding of photocatalytic materials. The technology will also form the core foundation of high performance and attractive residential products, which will improve indoor air quality in homes. Together, these applications hold the promise to broadly impact society by providing improved health for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve indoor air quality by developing a technology platform to enable efficient and effective point-of-use VOC removal in commercial, residential, and select industrial environments. Photocatalysts are widely known as effective chemical scrubbers and disinfectants. When exposed to UV light, the surfaces become chemically active via formation of reactive oxygen species. This surface chemistry has been proven effective to decompose toxic VOCs and to kill spores, bacteria, and viruses. Because it is harmful to humans, the use of UV light to activate the photocatalyst greatly limits implementation of this technology. Additionally, ineffective photocatalyst designs can result in incomplete decomposition of the VOCs. The goal of the current research is to develop a visible-LED-activated photocatalyst engineered to completely convert target VOCs to carbon dioxide and water. The improvements to the photocatalyst design will enable its implementation in luminaires that are easily integrated into the work environment at the point of VOC generation. The decomposition of VOCs at concentrations typically found in commercial and home environments will be explored using the developed photocatalyst, with particular attention given to the mitigation of by-products and the enhancement of photocatalyst lifetime.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a much-needed novel prosthetic
    valve that will provide a potential treatment option for the millions of U.S.
    patients suffering from chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). As people age, valves
    in the veins of their legs begin to function poorly. This allows blood to build
    up in the ankles due to gravity, leading to pain/swelling of the feet, skin discoloration,
    and ultimately open wounds by the ankles. As there is no approved venous valve
    on the market, current treatment consists of palliative options such as wound
    care and skin grafts. These treatments can cost tens of thousands of dollars per
    patient for non-healing venous stasis ulcers. The proposed technology will work
    to treat CVI while mitigating complications associated with prior attempts at
    valve prostheses, including formation of blood clots and valve breakdown. The
    approach described leverages a minimally invasive approach, averting costly expenditure
    and offering an up to 40% reduction in the cost of care in the first year of treatment.
    \ \n\nThe proposed project aims to develop a novel prosthetic valve technology
    to treat incompetent veins by targeting the underlying cause of the disease. In
    order to successfully progress on the path to commercialization, it is necessary
    to validate technologies such as this on the bench and in long-term animal trials.
    \ These steps provide the foundation for future clinical trials and ultimately
    use in the broader population. The objectives are to build the device, compare
    iterations on the bench, and validate the technology in animals. We anticipate
    selecting an iteration and having successful animal results. The proposed project
    will allow for further validation of safety and function of the described approach
    and progress on the path to commercialization."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. The compact and torque-controllable proposed actuator will prompt the development of a highly-potential upper-body exoskeletal rehabilitation robot that support a wide range of motion with an anatomical mobility and impedance-based dynamic behaviors. The high-performed exoskeleton will allow to implement contemporary therapeutic trainings based on neurological motor learning principles. This would enhance the efficacy of robotic rehabilitation leading to better recovery after neuromuscular injuries. Therefore, rehabilitation robots powered by the proposed actuator will be better accepted to physical rehabilitation market and bring a significant commercial impact. Ultimately, this project will contribute to reduction of socio-economic costs caused by neuromuscular impairments. Also, exoskeletons powered by the proposed actuator would contribute to better understanding of neurobehavioral principle of human body by serving as an experimental tool that creates force-based human-robot interactions with anatomical movements.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on developing a compact rotary-type series elastic actuators (SEAs) for upper-body exoskeleton application. A substantial portion of the US population suffers from neuromuscular impairments, requiring intensive rehabilitation services. Robotic rehabilitation has been attracting attention from many sectors because of the potential for better rehabilitation outcome. However, the lack of anatomical shoulder mobility and compliant dynamic control in existing upper-body exoskeletons limits the capability to produce neurologically-based therapeutic behaviors. The proposed SEAs will help to overcome the limitation by enabling exoskeletons to have force and impedance-based behaviors for advanced rehabilitation protocols. Its compact form factor will benefit the linkage design of exoskeletons for a wide range of motion and anatomical mobility. Also, the SEAs with the tight configuration and high torque/power capacity will provide a high flexibility in a variety of robot designs contributing to advances of general robotic technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the practical deployment of a computer-vision based yield estimation system in fruit orchards.  This will provide fruit farmers with a useful tool in planning their harvest and sales, as well as in managing the long-term health of their plants.  This will potentially reduce the inherent risk in fruit growing, thereby improving the affordability and availability of fresh fruit in the US.  Better certainty may particularly help small growers, because they have less existing capability to manage risk.  Furthermore, by allowing adoption of precision agriculture techniques techniques to high value crops, this project may help save water and contribute to reduction of runoff pollution from fertilizer and chemicals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of vision-based fruit detection and mapping of fruit, for purposes of yield mapping.  The research objectives are to improve the commercial usability and robustness of existing yield-mapping approaches, so that they can be applied in production fruit orchards.  The anticipated technical results of this project include demonstration of useful yield mapping of apples, in a variety of real world production orchard environments, in a variety of weather and lighting conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is maximizing chances for improved health, academic success, and post-secondary achievement of students who use School Based Health Centers (SBHCs) through creating more efficient, tailored services. These gains will contribute to students' improved social, economic, and health outcomes as adults, and a healthier U.S. population overall. The School-based Wellness Integrated Systems Hub (SWISH) will offer a comprehensive, online service documentation and data management system designed specifically for SBHCs. In contrast with traditional electronic health record systems, SWISH will serve as a single hub between data sources, eliminating the need for multiple systems. SWISH offers mechanisms for staff to identify clinical service priorities and those students in need of care. The platform, which complies with health, security and privacy regulations, provides functionality that supports the assessment, triage, coordination and provision of care across multiple roles within SBHCs. SWISH will also facilitate evaluation of service impact on student health, wellbeing and academic performance. This capability - not provided by existing market solutions - serves program efficiency and effectiveness goals and is likely to be well received by SBHC staff and administrators leading to robust commercialization of the product.

    The proposed project will develop and test a prototype data management system for School Based Health Centers (SBHCs). SBHCs are proliferating in the U.S; they are well positioned to address the unmet physical and mental health needs of underserved youth by increasing accessibility and continuity of health care on the school campus. Notably, while health information technology systems play a critical role in SBHC quality improvement, operations, and sustainability, a minority of SBHCs report having a data management system in place. This represents a critical infrastructure gap. The proposed technology will address this gap by providing a secure, shared environment specifically designed for SBHC providers to document service, utilize "smart list" algorithms to identify students in need of services, serve students efficiently, and coordinate care and resources within and outside the SBHC. To achieve these goals, the project team will: 1) apply their expertise in design, technology and project management to the creation of a Minimally Viable Product prototype; and 2) usability test SWISH with members of the target audience.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a significant increase in the efficiency of hospital operations.  The project focuses on the sources of inefficiencies in the planning, staffing, coordination, and execution of surgical procedures.  Preliminary analysis of hospital data shows that the throughput of perioperative units can be increased significantly with the same staffing while reducing the delays that patients experience and improving the working conditions of the personnel.  Such improvements have the potential of saving upwards of $1B per year. Delays in obtaining and communicating updates on the status of surgeries and on actions that personnel should perform are major causes of inefficiency, as is the randomness of the tasks' duration. The timing of those messages depends on the knowledge of the state of the system and a prediction about its future evolution. Delays in gathering information and incorrect predictions of the effect of actions result in reduced efficiency.  The proposed innovation improves the selection and timing of messages.

    The proposed project is based on a machine learning approach for the optimization of real-time messaging using actual hospital data. The approach combines new parametric models of real-time scheduling, stochastic gradient descent, and infinitesimal perturbation analysis. In this formulation, perturbation analysis computes the gradient of the objective function with respect to the timing of messages and results in an efficient algorithm.  The algorithm discovers the best time to send messages to optimize a combination of operating room efficiency and patient waiting times. The methodology is able to evaluate the complex cascading impact of scheduling decisions and to identify the best course of action when dealing with contingencies. Timely situation awareness will contribute to improved patient flow in the hospital.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop the necessary technology and manufacturing workflows to provide medical professionals with extremely realistic physical models of tissues and organs. The models will be manufactured rapidly (within a few hours), inexpensively, and on-demand. They will be patient-specific based on the patient?s CT and MRI scan data.  This will have profound implications on the planning of complex medical procedures such as tumor removal and will enable medical professionals and their teams to practice patient-specific surgical scenarios. This will improve surgical outcome, generate efficiencies in the operating room and decrease medical errors which, by some accounts, are the third largest cause of death in the United States. The ability to 3D print realistic human organ models will also provide medical students with a way to practice medical procedures with a wide degree of diversity. This will accelerate the learning rate and expand the breadth of training experiences.  Similarly, the models will provide a way for medical professionals to practice rare, high-risk procedures on-demand. The proposed 3D models will become a central part of the medical simulation toolbox and will enable a new generation of surgical planning and education.

    The ability to manufacture extremely realistic physical models rapidly, inexpensively, and on-demand relies on a novel multimaterial additive manufacturing process with a closed-feedback loop enabled by machine vision. This new process manufactures objects layer by layer, each layer made from a discrete set of elements, where each element is built from one material from a pallette of materials. The use of the closed-feedback loop system allows incorporating both liquids and solids with a wide range of mechanical and appearance properties. The development of a material palette that is necessary to mimic properties of real tissues will be a crucial part of the project. This material palette will be expanded by spatially combining base materials into composite structures. The second main thrust of the project relies on a software design workflow that translates geometric and material specifications describing a simulation model (e.g., an organ or a tissue) into multimaterial volumetric data. The volumetric data will be used as input to the multimaterial printing platform. The new design workflow requires development of modeling approaches that go beyond traditional, boundary-based CAD representations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the development and demonstration of a prototype position sensor that will help convert hydraulic and pneumatic actuators into ?smart? devices.  The position sensor will enable built-in self-diagnostics, precise feedback control, energy efficient operation, faster industrial manufacturing and material handling processes, and safer operations on mobile vehicles that take locations of obstacles and danger zones automatically into account during motion. The value proposition of the new sensor comes from its lower cost, ease of installation, and its non-contacting operation.  This project will help a start-up company demonstrate the performance of its sensor on multiple actuator products provided by large industrial and off-road mobile companies.  This is expected to result in establishing the viability of the sensor, customer orders for the sensor, and growth in company revenues. The technology area addressed by the research in this project is smart sensors and the targeted market sector is industrial machines and off-road agriculture and construction vehicles.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a prototype position sensor that is production-ready and ready for field testing in real-world industrial and mobile vehicle applications.  The sensor utilizes a large-distance magnetic field model, redundant magnetic sensors on a single sensor board and adaptive estimation algorithms to provide a novel position sensor that is small, non-intrusive, non-contacting, easy to install and lower cost compared to other position sensors on the market.  The innovations in the sensor technology being developed include the use of a nonlinear estimation algorithm that avoids differentiation of complex nonlinear functions, provides more accuracy and is computationally efficient for implementation on a microprocessor.  The sensor also includes an auto-calibration algorithm that corrects for sensor location and orientation errors so as to ensure accurate performance with changing cylinders.  The research project will demonstrate the performance of the sensor prototype in the lab on multiple actuators provided by collaborating large industrial and off-road vehicle companies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to innovate a novel patient tracking system, which will improve robotic surgery usability in an intra-operative environment. Robotic surgery is becoming ubiquitous across various medical procedures, and data continues to show improved clinical results. However, usability challenges impede broader adoption. This project will combine multiple tracking modalities, including mechanical and optical tracking, to create a hybrid tracking technology that allows for the advantages of each modality. This will optimize patient range of motion while minimizing line-of-sight challenges. This patient tracking technology can be used in conjunction with an existing robotic surgery system for dental implant procedures, which comprise a significant market opportunity. Dental implants are the standard of care for tooth replacement, and the dental implant market in the US is over $1 billion and growing nearly 8% per year with more than 14 million implants being placed annually worldwide. This technique can be used not only to revolutionize dental implant surgery, where the system is currently applied, but also to potentially create opportunities in other cranial procedures, which are otherwise burdened by invasive, cumbersome tracking technologies that impede intra-operative usability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of the first hybrid patient tracking device that combines mechanical and optical tracking methods. Optical tracking systems require that cameras have direct line-of-sight to several tracked markers in the surgical field, which poses a significant challenge to the surgeon and assistants that have to carefully avoid blocking the camera's field-of-view. Mechanical tracking systems limit a patient's range of motion and can be bulky. The success of this project will lead to the development of a robotic surgery system for dental implant procedures that encompasses: 1) pre-operative CT-based planning software, 2) a visual guidance system that provides on-screen graphics like a GPS system, 3) a hybrid optical and mechanical tracking system that monitors the patient position, and 4) a robot arm that physically grasps the drill at the same time as the surgeon in order to provide haptic feedback, constraining the surgeon to match the planned osteotomy. This system enables minimally invasive, flapless surgery that is shown to result in less pain for the patient and faster surgery. It is designed to be easy to use and seamlessly integrate into the surgeon's workflow.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be achieved through shifting the paradigm of waterway maintenance into a more regular occurrence, giving way to reduced pollutant levels in waterways, since they will be promptly removed instead of allowing them to accumulate toxins, and increase property values, utilization, and income within the marina industry. Additionally, embedded sensor intelligence and continuous waterway monitoring will grant the community and dredging regulatory agencies increased visibility and understanding of the health of the marine life in the waterway and allow them to more closely monitor environmental violations. With widespread adoption and further development, the innovation could potentially have far-reaching benefits in assisting with water and energy security by keeping inlet canals and reservoirs that comprise our society?s infrastructure clean and running at peak efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will aim to design, develop, and test an intelligent suction tip for use in year-round sediment removal in waterways. Current sediment removal technologies are destructive to marine ecosystems and costly to employ. As such, this project aims to develop an intelligent suction tip for marine life avoidance during robotic sediment removal in waterways. The project activities include the design and rapid prototyping of a suction tip filter that prevents fish entrainment, design and implementation of water quality sensors for environmental niche modeling, in-house saltwater testing, and marine representative freshwater testing.

    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate a novel method for additively manufacturing textile products. Presently, the clothing manufacturing industry still relies on manual sewing machines that were invented over one hundred and seventy years ago. This system limits the manufacturing process and textile capability; an abundance of steps leads to waste, inefficiencies, and segmented products. Further, due to the low cost of foreign labor, the US textile industry has essentially stalled, as 97.3 percent of all clothing sold in the United States in 2015 was imported. This project seeks to develop a novel method for manufacturing textile products by employing additive manufacturing methodologies to automate the production process, while simultaneously enabling complete customization and on-demand production. This technology will enable premium and competitive textile manufacturing to return from overseas, creating high value-added jobs and a designer community in the United States while also generating tax revenue. In the same way that 3D Printing technology has revolutionized the hard goods manufacturing process, this project seeks to create an entire new industry of additively manufactured textile products, enabling significant opportunities for future innovation.

    This project develops a novel technology to manufacture near-net-shape three dimensional textile products. To develop this technology, this project will first prove feasibility through creating constituent textile panels of non-standard shapes with 3D topography, laying the foundation for continued development into fully three-dimensional, seamless, finished products produced in-situ. By additively producing garments from a unique 3D model, complete customization to each individual consumer is possible on a large scale- though this has never before been accomplished. Further, through the on-demand production of clothing customized to individual consumers, the need for substantial inventory buildup is eliminated. In this way, additively manufactured textile products are both more desirable to consumers and more economical to producers. As such, the societal and environmental benefits of automated and on-demand textile manufacturing within the United States are significant, including eliminating massive amounts of waste from typical cut-and-sew manufacturing techniques, revamping a struggling American manufacturing industry, and minimizing the economical, environmental, and geopolitical implications of the United States' current dependence on a convoluted global supply chain.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel, fully-automated, non-contact metrology system that is accurate, repeatable, and cost-effective for comprehensive characterization of high-performance electronics, photonics, micro-fluidics, and biomedical device technologies. The innovative non-contact solution is free of the conventional wear and tear issues plaguing contact-based probing systems. The proposed technique could open up new research areas and directions that could have an immediate benefit to the entire semiconductor industry, thus broadly impacting all areas of our "information-driven" society. In particular, millimeter-wave and terahertz frequency bands (30-3000GHz) offer unique solutions to address key problems in sensing and spectroscopy, medical, pharmaceutical and security imaging, as well as extremely-high-data rate, ubiquitous communications. All-electronic integrated systems are badly needed for compact and cost effective applications in the above-mentioned areas. More importantly, testing and characterization of these new high-performance devices has been a challenge at their intended operation frequencies. Thus, there is ample need for comprehensive, high-performance metrology systems for characterizing entire electronic wafers automatically and without making physical contact. The automated probe system proposed here enables, for the first time, fast and accurate device and chip characterization, without making physical contact with the test wafer.

    The intellectual merit of this project is a novel non-contact probe system, based on wireless coupling of the test signals onto the test wafer, through on-chip antennas that are monolithically integrated with the test device. Since the physical contact to the test wafer is eliminated, there is no wear & tear to the chip or the test-bed, significantly improving reliability and repeatability as well as eliminating much of the associated testing costs. This innovative solution is scalable, and offers a comprehensive, elegant and cost-effective solution for single or differential-mode on-wafer characterization for the first time. Although the physical size of the on-chip antennas are slightly larger than typical contact-probe landing pads, the overall cost-savings in operation, labor, and maintenance offered by this innovative approach readily outweighs the on-chip real-estate occupied by the integrated antennas. Perhaps more importantly, this novel test-bed enables fully-automated, unattended testing of every single chip on an entire electronic wafer, even enabling continuous processing of multiple wafers without user involvement, thus providing significant savings in overall testing costs for high-speed electronic devices.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will focus on the development of a new
    alternative to Diesel engines for use in heavy-duty applications such as on-road
    transportation, off-road farm equipment, and stationary power generation. Currently,
    Diesel engines are used in all of these applications because they are robust and
    powerful. Unfortunately, they also produce significant smog, soot, and greenhouse
    gases that are damaging to individuals and the environment. In contrast, the engines
    developed under this project will have cleaner exhaust while producing more power
    at increased efficiency, all while utilizing inexpensive alternative fuels. Since
    Diesel-fueled engines move 70% of the world's goods, and produce 30% of distributed
    power around the globe, these engines are inextricably linked to quality of life,
    and transformational improvements in their operation can have a large, broad,
    positive impact on society. This project's new engines will continue to provide
    essential services, but in a way that reduces operating costs (creating savings
    that can be passed on to consumers) and emissions (further saving consumers money,
    and improving air quality in heavily-trafficked regions). These engines will fulfill
    a critical market need for clean, powerful engine solutions, and can be integrated
    into existing American-made engine product lines, increasing manufacturing revenue,
    stimulating job creation, and ensuring that the United States will remain a global
    leader heavy-duty engine production.\n\n \nThis project will focus on enabling
    these clean, powerful engines by developing a novel, high-temperature combustion
    system that allows traditional engines to be adapted to burn alternative fuels
    in an efficient and soot-free manner. This requires integration of a unique combination
    of technologies, joined in a way that provides benefits far greater than those
    that can be achieved with the individual components in isolation. Removing any
    piece from this specific combination drastically reduces performance. Because
    each component plays a critical role, this project has high risk (as each subsystem
    must function properly), but its sophistication also presents a high barrier to
    similar efforts (since incorrect use of any component yields significantly worse
    results). This project will build on previous proof-of-concept data that verified
    the feasibility of this concept, and will focus on the development of key engine
    subsystems, seeking to mitigate risk enough that investment from the private sector
    is possible. At the end of the project, the subsystems will be integrated into
    a stationary power generator as a retrofit to an existing Diesel engine, adapting
    it for alternative fuel use. This would serve as a prototype platform for the
    technology?illustrating its increased efficiency and power, along with reduced
    emissions?and demonstrating the value of the technology to market incumbents,
    hopefully spurring a licensing arrangement for engine production."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to help environmental engineers identify and delineate the bounds and concentrations of soil and groundwater contaminants with greater speed and accuracy. Over 30,000 contaminant spills have been identified in the United States alone, with thousands yet to be investigated and returned to safe levels.  The resources and effort being applied to these sites is insufficient to ensure the safety of the affected communities across America.  Focusing the remediation resources available, in the right place increases the rate at which federal and state regulators can close site investigations. As a result, environmental professionals will perform remediation earlier, making the site safe and productive again for local communities. The innovations developed in this project will enhance understanding of contaminant migration and develop a technical capability to use these findings to prepare more accurate conceptual site models during a contaminant investigation.  Faster site models resulting in successful remediation directly translates into cost savings for environmental clean-ups, reduction in damage to the environment, as well as increased throughput and efficiency for the environmental engineering industry.

         This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create unique summary models for the flow, extent, depth, and shape of contaminant plumes, with the goal of targeting resources to accelerate the remediation process for local communities. The project leverages algorithmically derived models of contaminant migration combined with public and private data from decades of environmental investigations across the country. Once the data are aggregated and analyzed, the project team will produce a collection of guideline statistics and software tools for use by engineers investigating future sites that are mathematically similar to those in the combined database. The project uses predictive algorithms to determine the likely extent of underground contaminations and applies statistical uncertainty measures to the conceptual site model. These mechanisms will enable environmental professionals to understand when and where additional data is required. In addition, by using a more accurate and sophisticated measure of uncertainty, the project?s models will provide definitive guidance to field engineers on where to collect new sample data and where they have sufficient certainty to remediate the site using excavation or other means.  These innovations will lead to the goal of safer and cleaner communities in less time, with fewer costs, with reduced environmental damage.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to demonstrate a reliable, low cost solid-state device for harvesting the wasted thermal energy released during regasification of LNG at gas terminals around the world. The proposed device will include thermoelectric elements incorporated directly into the LNG gasification heat exchanger, in order to harvest the temperature difference between cryogenic liquid and vaporized natural gas. Today, approximately 180 Billion kWh of energy (roughly equivalent to 5% of the total annual electricity consumption of the United States) is wasted annually at regasification terminals around the world, representing a huge addressable market for the proposed technology. Additionally, the proposed technology will benefit the US economy by making American LNG more cost-competitive in export markets.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of a thermoelectric generator integrated directly into an LNG regasification heat exchanger in order to effectively recover the latent energy released during regasification of LNG and convert it to electricity. The current state-of-the-art is based on gas turbines and expanders that rely on a combination of Rankine cycle and Brayton cycle. These technologies are complex, capital intensive, and costly to maintain. Consequently, they are seldom deployed at regasification terminals, resulting in massive energy waste. Direct conversion of the waste thermal energy to electricity through ?cryogenic? thermoelectrics is a practical and cost effective option. The proposed research will develop and demonstrate a laboratory prototype device integrated within a model plate-type LNG regasification heat exchanger. The main tasks include design of the system architecture, characterization of thermoelectric materials in cryogenic temperatures, modeling of heat transfer, prototype fabrication, and testing. Research will target design and process intensification, in order to minimize device cost.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to significantly increase recovery efficiency and decrease ecological footprint. The ecological footprint is decreased by reducing the amount of water required to produce oil and gas from many low permeability U.S. unconventional plays. Further, it will provide access to the vast reserves of potential oil and gas (estimated at greater than 2 trillion barrels) stored as immature organic material helping to enhance energy independence for the US. The new methods will enhance production of oil and gas from a controllable volume surrounding development wells.  The proposed methods will replace the rapid declines in well productivity of fracked wells, and the accompanying typically less than 10% recovery of hydrocarbons in place, by a strategy which will construct multi-year oil and gas "factories" which will have continuous, predictable, twenty year production lifetimes. Increased recovery factors through increased efficiency will enhance the value of existing plays and provide a step-change in sustainable energy production while lowering environmental impact through reducing surface disruption and minimizing water use and disposal.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the models necessary to simulate
    the Radio Frequency (RF) waterless stimulation process, and to provide laboratory and numerical data to support that model. A self-consistent model of the RF system and its downhole environment, is required to define the conditions for which RF stimulation makes economic sense, and to optimize system design for a given target play. Project objectives are to 1) demonstrate design of a RF system which mitigates the previous problems found with RF heating, 2) test in the laboratory the effects of RF heating on reservoir rock subject to realistic in situ conditions to understand the resultant crack field and accompanying permeability enhancement, including the impact of RF heating on immature kerogen, 3) model the resulting stress and fracture fields with sufficient fidelity to make predictions for oil and gas recovery, and 4) use this information to form a self consistent model of the process so that various shale plays can be evaluated. A commercial multiphysics numerical modeling approach will be used to simulate the physical processes that occur including feedback to account for temperature increases and the impacts of in situ stress and structural complexity.

    of a new type of implantable medical device for cartilage repair in the knee.
    The implant is based on a novel material that is cartilage-like, as well 3D printed
    designs. Currently, cartilage damage in the knee is most effectively treated by
    a metallic joint replacement. However, qualifying patient age is 55 or older.
    There are several implants available to a younger and more active patient population,
    but they all suffer from major limitations such as low success rate, the size
    of the damage they treat, long recovery time or high cost. This project will mature
    an implantable device that can support weight and encouraging new bone and cartilage
    formation. The device is also made from a high performance yet low cost material,
    and 3D printing can create custom made and made to order devices that increase
    efficiency and further reduce cost. A low-cost device which can decrease recovery
    time and increase clinical success would greatly improve treatment of young patients,
    and prevent more advanced joint disease.  The project supports the NSF?s mission
    by increasing knowledge surrounding the manufacturing and clinical use of biologically
    significant materials for orthopedics. \n\nThis project will develop an ?on demand?
    device to adequately fill and support a critical-sized cartilage defect while
    quickly grafting to underlying subchondral bone, thus providing a new solution
    to the treatment of full-thickness cartilage tissue injury. Full-thickness cartilage
    lesions often are associated with a low rate of success and high patient morbidity
    (meaning 60% treatment failure) due to the need for adequate vasculature in the
    subchondral bone and integration with the cartilage graft. Researchers have used
    complex biomimetic nanomaterials and 3D printing to create strategies for joint
    repair. These materials work well in a controlled laboratory setting, but as is
    can only be printed using deposition or extrusion-based 3D printing techniques.
    This type of additive manufacturing is limited by resolution and print speed /
    volume when compared to commercial laser-based systems. The significance of this
    project is tied into improving clinical outcomes, with a more mechanically and
    biologically stable implant, while also addressing these manufacturing and cost
    issues. Thus, this project will validate the efficacy of an implantable cartilage
    repair device, made from new tissue growth materials and designs compatible with
    selective laser sintering, and provide critical scientific validation of a functional
    medical implant for orthopedic treatment."

    This SBIR Phase I Project is designed to enable the wide acceptance of hydrogen as a green alternative to gasoline and diesel.  To accomplish this goal, a way had to be found to safely and economically store, transport and use hydrogen.  A class of organic compounds has been discovered that can store hydrogen, release it as needed, and form a recyclable residual compounds. By holding hydrogen on a liquid carrier at normal temperatures and pressures, the cost and complexity of compressing or liquefying hydrogen has been eliminated.  The same infrastructure that supplies us with gasoline, diesel and ethanol can be used without modification to transport this hydrogen liquid. A safe and economical means for capturing, storing, transporting and dispensing hydrogen will enable green technologies for making hydrogen from wind, solar, biomass and tidal energy.  Possibilities exist for using CO2 as a component to make these carrier molecules from hydrated ethanol. Hydrogen can be mixed 50/50 with diesel fuel to cut harmful diesel emissions in half including diesel soot which has been implicated in the rise in childhood asthma.

    This project combines the skills of organic chemists, nanotechnology, 3D fabrication engineers and computer-controlled electronics drivers to deliver a novel result. Achieving uniform heating of a catalytic volume is key to producing the desired output without byproducts and fouling of the catalytic surfaces. Since the anticipated reactions are endothermic and the flow rates for commercial applications are high, the research is focused on developing precise control of heat transfer into the reactor core through design and experiments. The experimental plan also involves evaluation of multiple materials for the induction heating elements, the effect of location in the solenoid barrel of the reactor core, and the various methods available to bind multiple, very small Reactor tubes together to create the Cores. The goal is to demonstrate capability for generating hydrogen output of 33 gaseous liters per
    minute for a 5 kW fuel cell.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be seen in the strengthening of the renewable energy landscape, in the diversification of our energy sources, and ultimately in the reduction of fossil fuel?s impact on human health and the environment as our society moves toward clean electrification of our energy supply and distribution systems. Due to the low cost of its raw materials, intrinsic scalability and rapid evolution of efficiencies, perovskite solar cells are the ideal candidates to validate thin film photovoltaics as a safe, commercially viable and economically sustainable source of energy. This rapidly emerging technology is compatible with existing silicon photovoltaics and can be combined with them to enhance their efficiencies, or can be used as stand-alone devices that can ultimate meet or exceed the performance of silicon while enabling an intrinsically inexpensive and scalable manufacturing process. Initial studies predict an estimated cost of production of modules lower than $0.28/W after amortization of initial capital investment, which translates into a cost of production ~30% lower than that of current photovoltaic technologies.

    The proposed project will provide a solution to a key degradation mechanism that affects the lifetime performance of perovskite photovoltaics. Degradation is caused by trapping of charges at the interface between the light absorbing perovskite layer and the electron transport layer, typically TiO2, which leads to the breakdown of the perovskite structure through a sequence of chemical reactions. In this project TiO2 will be replaced by SnO2 (either intrinsic or doped) which has an electronic band structure that matches very closely with new high efficiency perovskite compositions. Additionally, SnO2 is considerable less expensive than TiO2, easier to deposit with high quality, i.e. low density of electronic defects,  and it is more environmentally robust in the presence of moisture and oxygen than TiO2. SnO2 also does not photocatalyze degradation pathways of the perovskite layer, which is recently thought to be occurring with TiO2. Preliminary laboratory work using SnO2 as an electron transport layer yielded efficiencies comparable to cells manufactured using TiO2 (~18%), but more importantly, tests showed virtually no degradation after 500 hours of operation. Our goal is to further improve the properties of the perovskite cells (efficiency and stability) while developing a robust, inexpensive deposition process for SnO2.

    The broad impact of this SBIR Phase I project is  in the development of a new cokeless process to melt iron and scrap steel while meeting  stringent environmental regulations. The process being investigated will potentially shift the paradigm of difficult pollution control to the use of a clean fuel, such as natural gas.  It has the potential to cut down 75% of the greenhouse gas emissions by comparison with coke fired cupolas that continue to cover 70% of the world production of castings. By leveraging the existing network of natural gas pipelines, it intends to put back the US at the forefront of developing clean technologies for metal casting and provide opportunities to expand to new foundries.

    The proposal focuses on a specially designed furnace that primarily incorporates two interconnected chambers with two different zones of melting and superheating. This design is aimed at overcoming the limitations of natural gas fired cokeless cupolas and rotary furnaces,and rapidly dwindling coke-fired open hearth furnaces.  The key objective of this project is to demonstrate  that the innovative furnace can melt pig iron at the required rate, but with lower pollution emissions than competitive technologies, and in compliance with stringent environmental regulations. In particular emissions of CO2, lead, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates will be lowered by finding a range of favorable operating conditions through systematic experimentation. Slag damage to  furnace lining will also be managed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a dialysis-like platform for selective bacterial separation and removal from blood. This technology could potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapy for the treatment of disease, including sepsis. Sepsis, a life threatening organ dysfunction caused by infection, is a condition where the risk of death is extremely high (25%-72%), yet no effective treatments exist. In the US, over 1M people suffer from sepsis annually. Sepsis is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, costing more than $20 billion per year. There are currently no approved therapies in the US to treat sepsis. This developing technology will serve as an effective, next-generation sepsis treatment through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from blood. The technology in this project holds many advantages over competitors, including increased effectiveness, hemocompatibility, elimination of pore size limitations, and elimination of clogging issues. Commercialization of this innovation may reduce sepsis-associated length of stay, decrease mortality rates, and potentially reduce the current $23.7B annual US expenditure for sepsis. Fundamental understanding generated by this work has alternative applications, including the development of diagnostic devices for rapid infection detection.

    The proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of a novel, fluidic platform to provide a more effective and rapid method of bacterial and endotoxin removal from circulation for the treatment of sepsis. Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and no effective therapy exists for the syndrome. The anticipated research involves 1) scale up of the device for operation at flow rates suitable for humans, 2) developing features for bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) evaluation of the rate of bacterial and endotoxin capture from fluid circulating through the scaled-up fluidic platform. It is anticipated that this work will result in a fluidic platform capable of removing pathogens and associated toxins from blood at a clinically translatable flow rate. The goal of this work is to provide an easy to use, cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and capture of bacteria and associated toxins from circulating fluid and to facilitate the use offluidic platforms as research tools. Successful completion of these studies will establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform and enable the subsequent development of a prototype device for field testing.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use shape-morphing electroactive polymers
    (EAPs), also known as synthetic muscle, to provide for a streamlined and very
    life-like way of configuring motion, which doesn't require motors, pulleys, gears,
    or cables like traditional mechanical based motion.  The power to operate these
    EAPs is easily provided by electric input, including using off the shelf commercially
    available batteries.  In addition to the focus of this proposal on adjustable
    liners, these EAPs could mend the gap between form and function for life-like
    prostheses.  As impact attenuating and sensing materials, these EAPs could be
    developed to offer solutions for protective equipment and provide life-like motion
    and control for robotics.  This proposal is focused on transforming the standard
    of care for people who have lost limbs or were born without fully developed limbs.
    \ \n\nThe proposed project promises to transform the standard of care for people
    who have lost limbs or were born without fully developed limbs.  Amputees using
    mechanically driven prostheses often experience increasing pain, as well as risk
    of skin breakdown and severe infections, even over the course of daily use, due
    to normal anatomical changes in the limb that are not accommodated by the static,
    rigid socket of their prosthetic device. Typically, most amputees' residual limbs
    shrink over the course of any given day, much like peoples' foot size changes
    from morning to evening.  This proposed work aims to resolve the inadequacies
    of current prosthetic socket fit by using flexible pads of EAP based synthetic
    muscle, built into prosthetic liners, to automatically respond to changes in patient
    anatomy and ensure a continuously proper socket fit throughout the day.  With
    the additional ability to sense pressure, these EAPs can also serve as a diagnostic
    tool to prevent skin breakdown. The prosthetic device and human should move as
    one, effortlessly and naturally.  This proposal will develop self-adjusting prosthetic
    liners that responds to residual limb changes, maintaining a comfortable dynamic
    perfect fit throughout the day, to allow the patient to easily and comfortably
    engage in an active lifestyle."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will determine the feasibility of a new
    high risk technology for treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
    The technology is an AAV2-mediated concurrent expression of recombinant proteins
    to intracellularly suppress the critical growth factors VEGF-A (vascular endothelial
    growth factor A) and PDGF-B (platelet-derived growth factor) in a single injection.
    \ AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the US. The standard of care intravitreal
    anti-VEGF (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) injections (injected monthly)
    achieve an initial improvement in visual acuity in the first 3 or 4 months of
    treatment is followed by a plateau that persists for 2 years, followed by visual
    decline over the subsequent 5 years. Studies examining retinal remodeling provided
    initial clues as to the importance of VEGF and PDGF in wet AMD, while work in
    cancer models provided an impetus to pursue anti-VEGF/PDGF combination therapy
    for the treatment of wet AMD. This project will lead to an effective product for
    the treatment of wet AMD and related diseases.  A long-term VEGF inhibition and
    PDGF suppression without repetitive intravitreal injections would significantly
    reduce the number of intraocular injections and the risks of infection, bleeding,
    retinal detachment, fibrosis, and pain for the patient. \n\nThis project proposes
    an AAV2-delivery vehicle for expressing intraceptors which sequester VEGF-A and
    PDGF-B. The primary innovation is the development of a novel gene therapy to concurrently
    suppress VEGF-A and PDGF-B, using a bicistronic AAV2 vector.  The proposed studies
    in mice will determine feasibility for potential commercialization of this alternative
    which would be injected annually and provide long-term sustained suppression of
    the two key mediators of neovascular AMD, including the potential for reduced
    fibrosis (scarring) with PDGF-B blockade. Further, this therapy?s ability to block
    intracellular autocrine loops may complement or improve upon the efficacy of current
    extracellular treatments, while avoiding neurotoxicity of diffuse extracellular
    VEGF suppression. This project?s innovations earned a patent in 2012 (US Patent
    No. 8,211,864 B2). The proposal will refine the product and develop a modified
    AAV virus with selective tropism for CNV and minimize off-target side effects.
    \ The proposed feasibility studies Aims 1 and 2 will establish a baseline for
    future safety and efficacy studies in non-human primates which is a key mile stone
    for investors. Aim 1 will involve AAV2 manufacture, while Aim 2 will evaluate
    safety and efficacy, using histology, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence
    tomography."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project to develop a low-cost photovoltaic (PV) inverter is to reduce the installed cost of solar energy systems by ~10%. This improvement in power electronics has a direct positive commercial impact on the entire solar industry by greatly expanding the addressable market where solar generation is economic. Societal impacts include lowering energy costs, facilitating employment growth, driving economic development, and lowering emissions. The project also supports an enhanced scientific and technological understanding of a class of novel inverter architectures that may find numerous other applications outside of the solar industry. For example, industrial motor drives, wind turbines, battery energy storage, and electric vehicles each make use of DC-AC (direct current ? alternating current) conversion technologies that could benefit from these novel architectures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses two major problems in the solar PV industry: (1) there is tremendous pressure to reduce costs in the DC-AC inverter, and (2) there is pressure to improve the performance of inverters, both by increasing energy yield under partial shading conditions and by improving the lifetime of inverters. The objectives of the proposed research are to demonstrate maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and grid synchronization for a prototype distributed inverter that can achieve performance comparable to commercial inverters while being mass-produced at a lower cost. The research includes a) refinement and application of a real-time inverter control algorithm to extract the maximum energy from solar panels under dynamic shading conditions, b) establishing robust communications across a network of distributed inverters, and c) fabricating and demonstrating a system with a pathway to performance parity with commercial inverters at a much lower cost. Anticipated technical results include measurement of conversion efficiency, power quality, component count, and bill of material estimates.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate
    isolation pads made of a novel class of metamaterials to reduce seismic vibrations
    of equipment and buildings. Use of traditional seismic isolation materials often
    leads to restricted design spaces and needs expensive full-scale device testing,
    which make the technology unfeasible for extensive application. The internal architecture
    of the high-performance materials to be studied and optimized in this work can
    enlarge the design space to embrace objects as small as an expensive equipment
    and as large as a major bridge. Simplification of testing protocols due to the
    shift of the isolation property from the device to the material level adds to
    the Broader Impacts by making seismic isolation accessible for a wide range of
    applications. The high level of seismic protection provided by this technology
    constitutes an immediate value for commercial activities that require continuity
    of operations after earthquakes. The initial target is the fast growing market
    of data centers, with the potential for follow-on market in residential housing
    construction. The extensive application of the innovation has the potential of
    increasing the resiliency of communities in areas prone to seismic activity and
    reducing related direct and indirect losses. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this
    project derives from the development of an optimization framework for the internal
    architecture of metamaterials for enhanced seismic protection. There has not been
    a fundamental study to optimize metamaterials based on manufacturing tolerances,
    costs, and performance for seismic applications. This work will contribute to
    developing a set of design principles for optimized internal material architectures
    depending on desired seismic performance. Experimental investigations will be
    carried out to validate the methodology and to prove the feasibility of replacing
    device testing with material coupon testing to certify metamaterial pads for seismic
    isolation. This will include the investigation of processing methods to manufacture
    material assemblies with uniform mechanical properties, and will involve both
    static and dynamic testing of the material. The key technical objectives of the
    project are 1) the development of the optimization design framework based on manufacturing
    and seismic performance constraints, and 2) the material testing protocol to verify
    scalability and defect insensitivity of the material property. It is anticipated
    that the metamaterial architecture can be modulated to provide seismic isolation
    property beyond state of the art seismic isolation devices, and can be scaled
    from material coupons to large assemblies without significant property modification."

    a change in concept and technical paradigm for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) technology,
    and as such shall significantly impact research and development in both industry
    and academia.  As discussed in the Technical Merits below, the proposed AFM is
    fast, smart, and more powerful in terms of imaging and probing local mechanics.
    \ The company has a track record of commercializing AFM controllers that are compatible
    with most all types of scanners, commercial and home-constructed.  Current AFM
    users can purchase the new scanner and/or controller to attain the enhanced performance.
    In addition, new AFM users are also anticipated especially in the areas of nanomaterials,
    devices and sensors, and multidimensional devices and materials where both high
    spatial and temporal resolutions are paramount.  Further, the combined high spatial
    resolution in conjunction with fast speed shall result in immediate advances in
    the fields of material development, surface coating, nanomaterial and nanodevice
    inspection and quality control, nanolithography, and tissue engineering.  Based
    on current market trends, sales are anticipated to reach $25M within the first
    three years.  The amount is likely higher given the forecasted growth of the global
    microscopy market. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project includes three cutting
    edge improvements to current AFM: (1) faster image acquisition speed; (2) automated
    and rapid feature finding and tracking; (3) 1-2 orders of magnitude of improvement

    be achieved by implementing a novel reconfigurable processor optimized for AFM
    into a unique hybrid, low-noise controller architecture, which is highly versatile
    and compatible with various known configurations of AFM microscopes from many
    different vendors.  In addition, the automatic feature finding and tracking functions

    novel scan pattern, completely different from current ?trace-retrace? scanning
    trajectory in current AFM.  These new and ?smart? approaches further speed up
    scanning and tracking speed.  Finally, the AFM will be able to produce nanomechanical
    images with high speed and accuracy using multifrequency spectroscopy. This concept
    has been proposed, and individual aspects have been demonstrated in isolation
    through simulations or lab prototypes over the past five years or more.  The faster

    This STTR Phase I projects aims to address major limitations in the analysis of pharmaceuticals that are based on proteins, a group of therapeutics known as biologics.  Current methods for sample preparation and analysis of these drugs require highly trained staff and expensive equipment to execute the multitude of different analytical approaches that are employed to characterize these molecules. Both personnel and equipment costs combine to limit the number of drug candidates evaluated by pharma companies, makes it more difficult for regulatory agencies to reproduce data provided in applications and makes it difficult to identify counterfeit drugs. The company aims to address this issue by creating a highly flexible sample preparation device based on a fluidic channel that operates at reduced pressure. Proteins trapped within the channel can undergo digestion, reduction, alkylation and other common sample preparation procedures in an unattended and automated fashion. Subsequently, prepared samples may be eluted at high concentration, ready for downstream analysis.  By dramatically reducing the equipment costs and reducing the required expertise for sample preparation, the company?s technology will have a large impact on the number of drug candidates that are evaluated by pharma companies, it will make it easier for regulatory agencies to reproduce data provided by manufacturers, and it will improve their ability to detect counterfeit drugs. All of these benefits will result in more and cheaper biologics making it to the market, ultimately improving the health and wellness of the populace.

    The company?s device combines concepts of diafiltration, asymmetric flow field flow fractionation and filter assisted sample preparation to create an automated sample preparation platform that avoids the use of robotics. By avoiding robotics and high pressure, the platform can operate with increased robustness and dramatically reduced cost. The proposed research aims to demonstrate the ability of the device to perform common sample preparation steps, such as reduction/denaturation, digestion, and deglycosylation and assess issues of reproducibility, reliability and carryover. While many of the workflows described herein have been demonstrated in molecular weight cutoff filters, implementation of these within a fluidic channel will directly advance the company?s understanding of the mechanisms of loss in sample preparation, provide a refined estimate of the cost savings that might be achieved in real world applications, and improve our understanding of transport for small molecules across these membranes.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks development
    of a novel dosimeter for 2-D mapping of radiation dose in real-time at sub-millimeter
    spatial resolution. The high spatial resolution of the dosimeter is essential
    in supporting stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation
    therapy (SBRT) treatments. These rapidly emerging modalities deliver precise doses
    of radiation to small, well defined treatment sites while minimizing exposure
    of critical neighboring anatomy. With the annual number of SRS/SBRT treatments
    approaching 1,000,000 and growing 5-10% annually there is a market need for a
    dosimeter with sub-millimeter resolution and the capability of measuring in real-time.
    The routine pre-treatment verification of each patient therapy plan becomes a
    target application. The value of the market for the dosimeter alone exceeds $10
    million annually. The value is amplified through enablement of the safe and efficacious
    delivery of SRS and SBRT treatments.  Use of these modalities greatly impacts
    the efficiency of radiotherapy by substantially reducing the number of individual
    sessions in a course of treatment. The net result is lower cost for the treatment
    course, an increase in the number of patients/year for each linear accelerator
    equipment unit and a large reported improvement in patient outcomes.      \n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this project lies in combining and adapting key elements
    of two well-established commercial technologies, piezoelectric polymers and radiochromic
    film, to produce a hybrid dosimeter. This dosimeter preserves the high spatial
    resolution of radiochromic film while improving its usability by making the changes
    caused by radiation exposure to become detectable by electronic means in real-time.
    During use, the flexible, single-use piezoelectric array dosimeter (PARD) fits
    into a re-usable data acquisition electronics module that transmits a map of measured
    doses to a Medical Physicist outside the radiation cell. Radiochromic film, the
    only current dosimeter with sub-millimeter spatial resolution, is inconvenient
    owing to the long delay between exposure and measurement as well as the extra
    time and effort in facilitating the measurements. This drawback adversely impacts
    its usefulness in the day-to-day verification of patient treatment plans. The
    hybrid PARD product provides a dense, flexible array (0.1 mm spacing) of detectors
    with the unique ability for dose measurement at sub-millimeter resolution in real
    time. This overcomes key drawbacks of existing electronic array devices which
    are incapable of spatial resolution below 5 mm and unsuitable for the small radiation
    fields associated with SRs and SBRT treatments."

    The commercial potential of this project lies in enabling much needed high wireless data rates and equal quality of service (QoS) to both densely populated areas as well as remote rural areas. 4G cellular and WiFi networks are facing a bottleneck due to proliferation of wireless devices and limited spectrum available in the currently allocated bands for wireless communications. Improving data connectivity would require new physical fiber to be laid out which is becoming impractical due to high costs vs. return on investment. The Federal Communications Commission has opened more spectrum in the mm-wave frequency spectrum (between 28-70 GHz) for mobile users to alleviate some of these issues. This project will enable spectrally efficient communication through frequency reuse for spatially separated mobile users in the mm-wave frequencies. It will also allow low cost dense deployment of 5G cellular base-stations to boost QoS. With this new paradigms in human machine interaction using machine learning can be advanced further. Remote educational programs, virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) based learning, online health care and other new services around Internet of Things will be enhanced by better wireless connectivity. These technologies will uplift people?s lives delivering major economic and broad societal impact.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a revolutionary architecture that will enable massive multi-user MIMO techniques for mm-wave wireless systems to solve the spectrum scarcity issue. The mm-wave radio front end module (FEM) can reuse the same frequencies for spatially diverse mobile users with active beamforming thus enhancing the capacity of current cellular networks by 100x. A multitude of modules (1000s) will be used in a large array as a part of the mm-wave FEM making it crucial to achieve excellent power efficiency at the module level. This project will investigate a variant of Doherty power amplifier (PA) architecture to achieve highly efficient mm-wave transmitter. Module to module variation and within module variations can disturb accurate beamforming capability. Impact of these variations on forming coherent beams will be studied. A new method to calibrate a large array to tune out any module to module variation will be proposed through sufficient redundancies incorporated in the module design. Low sensitivity to calibration errors will be achieved while also trying to lower the calibration time. A new algorithm that achieves accurate simultaneous tracking of spatial mobile users to within 5-degrees using the new architecture will be proposed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the management of clotting
    and bleeding which is a major clinical challenge that costs > $100B healthcare system burden. In
    the United States, it affects more than ten million patients of major surgery, trauma,
    cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancers. The underlying biology is a complex orchestration of
    protein and cellular pathways that react in the context of blood flow. Proven diagnostic tools that
    capture this complexity, and also meet the constraints of diverse challenges do not exist. This
    project intends to create a novel modular hemostasis test platform using proprietary microsystem
    modules deployed in configurable cartridges tailored to meet clinical requirements. Initially a
    3D microelectrode based platelet function test module will be developed and optimized with
    potential for best in class performance following multi-scale optimization of the dynamic,
    physical diagnostic environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a simple, low
    cost platelet function assay (PFA) with the objective of delivering best in class performance via
    multiscale optimization of the local biophysical diagnostic environment. Multiplate Electrode
    Aggregometry (MEA), a macroscale impedance-based device has already shown promise, yet
    remains cumbersome and has suboptimal classification accuracy between patient subsets. In
    MEA tests, as with most PFAs, the role of local fluid shear and macro/microscale physical
    environment remains largely neglected despite their well-recognized role in platelet response.
    Preliminary work suggests untapped potential in controlling and modifying PFA performance.
    By optimizing these signals with respect to clinical end points and subpopulation differentiation,
    this shear-based micro-platelet function test modules stand to revolutionize platelet function
    testing for the broadest possible benefits.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development and validation of technologies that enable electric energy systems to operate reliably and affordably with very large amounts of renewable energy. Clean, reliable and affordable electricity is vital to modern society.  However the variability of wind and solar generation can lead to catastrophic grid reliability problems if real-time demand does not match the supply.  This project will develop and demonstrate a system to manage distributed (e.g., rooftop) solar photovoltaic systems operating with and without local electrical energy storage (i.e., batteries) in a way that extracts the most value for the customer, while simultaneously improving the reliability of the electricity infrastructure.  The project will leverage algorithms inspired by those used by millions of devices to send data over the Internet.  Like Internet data, energy will be delivered in discrete energy packets. These packets are coordinated independently, anonymously, and fairly to simultaneously solve real-world grid problems and provide value to end-users. The result of this project will be an integrated software-as-a-service and hardware solution in which customers gain incentives for participating and electricity industry members realize savings by reducing infrastructure needs, such as additional fossil fuel generation.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will enable the decentralized, randomized, and bottom-up coordination of two- and four-quadrant power-electronic inverters attached to solar photovoltaic and electric battery storage systems. In contrast to competing, centralized, top-down scheduling approaches, the proposed technology enables inverters to regulate both active and reactive power output according to an automaton that undergoes probabilistic state-transitions based on both real-time local measurements and communication with an aggregator. By incorporating local measurements, the method ensures that the energy needs of the end-use consumer are met while providing flexibility to a load aggregator or electric utility. This flexibility will enable distribution utilities to manage feeder power flows, losses, and voltage constraints. The probabilistic nature of the coordination prevents harmful synchronization effects, such as oscillations, while maintaining privacy of end-consumers through anonymous interactions akin to how data packets are routed on the Internet. Upon completion of the project, a commercially viable, human-friendly software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology will be demonstrated that implements this decentralized approach to coordinate distributed inverters in a manner that is compatible with modern grid operations.

Manufacturers use absorbers to protect their products from unwanted Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and to meet Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations and standards. EMI from external and internal sources can degrade the operation and performance of electronics. The demand for EMI absorbing materials that are cost effective, lightweight, thin, flexible and wide-spectrum continues to grow rapidly as microwave communications and mobile technologies become ubiquitous. The overall EMI shielding market exceeded $5.4 billion in 2015 and is expected to grow to $7.8 billion in the next 5 years. Absorber materials developed in this project can be applied to almost any type of antenna, circuit board, cable, gasket or enclosure. The project goal and broader impacts of this technology are development of lightweight, thin, high performance, microwave absorber materials that provide increased energy efficiency, design flexibility, reduced costs and improved connectivity for a wide range of markets, applications, products and devices. The product is suitable for many market sectors including automotive, consumer electronics, telecom and aerospace where thin, lightweight and wide-spectrum response is needed.

    The intellectual merit of the project will be the creation of new CF composites for microwave absorption. This project will measure and define the fundamental electromagnetic absorption parameters of these composites in the 1 - 12 GHz range. Characterization data such as dielectric constants, complex electric permittivity, magnetic permeability, loss tangents and layer thickness of the absorbers will be measured and derived. Such parameterization is essential for simulation modeling and design optimization of such absorbers for various markets and applications. Absorber attenuation and frequency response will be simulated and validated with laboratory transmission line and reflectivity testing. These composites use both magnetic and dielectric mechanisms to absorb microwave energy. Composite CF absorber materials are nonconductive and rely on insertion loss and impedance matching and/or cavity resonance effects. Processes, techniques and equipment needed for commercial production will be investigated. Graduate students and faculty will be supported in development of test, measurement and modeling techniques. The execution of the project will demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of using CF composites as microwave absorbing materials and will provide a pathway to commercialization and product design. Successful completion of the project will create new high performance materials for the aerospace, automotive and consumer markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable the efficient use of wireless
    spectrum. Over the last decade, the world has seen a sharp increase in the number and diversity
    of mobile devices. With this surge in mobile devices, access to spectrum has become an
    overarching issue impacting the everyday life of citizens. The demand is expected to grow
    exponentially in the coming years, with the rapid adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) linking
    everything we interact with in daily life. The technology developed under this project will allow
    communication devices to listen and broadcast simultaneously, on the same frequency, thus
    effectively doubling spectrum utilization by operating in Full Duplex (FD) mode. By improving
    spectral efficiency and simplifying frequency planning, the results from this project will enable
    newer paradigms for the rapid design, development and deployment of mobile devices. Society
    as a whole will benefit from the increased array of applications enabled by robust, spectrally
    efficient communication devices. Furthermore, valuable spectrum assets will be released and can
    be redirected to create new opportunities for growth.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a practical Full-duplex
    communication system prototype. The goal of the project is to develop a functional prototype
    showing the ability of fast cancellation that enables reliable full duplex operation at transmit
    powers suitable for outdoor deployment. While Full Duplex has been shown to be achievable
    under static channel conditions, maintaining the desired isolation between transmit and receive
    path in a dynamic channel is difficult, mainly due to the high level of reflected power into the
    radio system that can limit its performance. By deploying novel and efficient cancellation
    methodologies the prototype will be able to track and compensate for moving targets as they
    appear in the radiation space of the FD system. Innovative co-designed spatial, analog and digital
    approaches will be used to converge on the optimal parameters for cancellation, while ensuring
    a rapid response time. All proposed algorithms under this project will be tested on a real-time FD
    prototype system, under realistic wireless channel condition, to ensure that practical issues are
    accounted for.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a device for better, early screening of sepsis.  Sepsis costs the U.S. health care system over $24 billion every year, with as many as 3.1 million cases that claim over 300,000 lives annually. One out of every two to three hospitals deaths in the U.S. is due to sepsis. There are an estimated >19 million cases worldwide, and some reports have estimated that 1 person dies from sepsis every 4 seconds. Mortality rates due to severe sepsis are between 20% and 50%. The most urgent problem is a lack of accurate early screening methods. Survival rates drop by 7.6% per hour treatment is delayed. Current screening for sepsis utilizes the SIRS criteria, which include temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and total WBC count. These parameters have very low specificity for early screening of sepsis. This project will replace these parameters with a panel of cell and protein biomarkers to provide highly specific and sensitive detection and stratification for sepsis. A hand-held point-of-care device and a one-time-use cartridge capable of providing total white blood count, lymphocyte, granulocyte/monocyte, and CD64 Neutrophils all from one drop of blood in a single cartridge will be developed. Such a system could save hundreds of thousands of lives and billions of dollars in healthcare costs every year in the United States.

    This project will develop a point of care sensor that can measure cell counts and proteins from a drop of blood. The technology combines the power of microfluidics, microfabrication, and on-chip electrically based cell and particle counting to develop a revolutionary new technology that combines electrical coulter counting with immuno-capture of cells and particles. The developed device would be the only one with the capability to offer in a single device the critical information of hematology analyzers, flow cytometers, protein, and DNA assays. This project enables the power of all of these tools to be harnessed from a single inherently simple, powerful, and scalable, platform. Such a device could dramatically increase both the frequency and the multiplexing of sampling of biomarkers from patient populations. In this proposal, commercial grade cartridges  will be used to develop protein measurements for procalcitonin, an FDA approved biomarker for sepsis, in addition to cell counting, from drop of blood of healthy and sick patients from hospital settings.

    The broader reaching impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research project stems from the development and application of a new generation of cost-effective devices that can efficiently recover, preserve and quantify airborne microbes in near real time.  An improved ability to characterize the microbiology of indoor aerosols has a multitude of important engineering and public health benefits for urban society. This includes a vastly improved ability to monitor bioaerosols in health care settings; in water-damaged buildings; in plane/rail/bus transportation centers; as well as other high-density public venues.  Through this work, emerging aerosol technology will be optimized and deployed in portable instrumentation that reports what currently marketed aerosol monitoring equipment cannot provide: the identity, distribution and abundance of airborne microorganisms indoors.  This approach provides an unprecedented path to compile large exposure databases, which enable the scientific and medical community to better understand the potential effects of indoor microbial air pollution.  Compared to conventional aerosol sampling, these new filter-less devices require little human oversite, communicate aerosol data to cloud-based servers, and preserve bioaerosol samples with exceptional fidelity.  These next generation instruments provide an innovative, unobtrusive and practical method for surveying the indoor air we breathe every day, in near real-time.

    This STTR Phase I project integrates portable lasers for real-time microbe enumeration, with humidity controls that efficiently recover bacteria, fungi and pollen from indoor air. This advanced equipment assembly accurately counts, preserves and concentrates airborne microbes for stringent biochemical analysis that is relevant to public health.  The opportunity for this new instrumentation leverages the fundamental technological advantages it has over conventional sampling equipment, which until now predominantly relies on filtering large quantities of indoor air.   The mechanical stresses microbes must endure during conventional air filtration, seriously compromises the accuracy of airborne microbial analyses.  The research objective of this work is to challenge this novel instrumentation array with known quantities of airborne microbes that commonly inhabit the indoor environment.  Using widely accepted engineering and biochemistry methods, the overarching goal is to systematically validate the efficiency of this new equipment, both in the laboratory and in the field.  We anticipate markedly better quantitative recovery of airborne microbial activity and genetic material (DNA) where directly compared to its filter-based counterparts.  Thus, the commercial and societal value of this new instrumentation is realized through displacing outmoded aerosol collection methods with highly efficient filter-less air sampling devices, outfitted with modern optics and digital automation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to create a personalized, precision-based practice paradigm for surgery that improves surgical outcomes and reduces the cost of healthcare. This paradigm utilizes individual patient characteristics with machine-learning algorithms to accurately predict the risk of post-surgical complications. Additionally, it offers the possibility of enacting impactful interventions among high-risk patients, while reducing unnecessary therapies among low-risk patients, thereby improving surgical outcomes, maximizing the efficiency of healthcare, and minimizing cost. In a value-based care model, this paradigm aligns the goals of health systems, surgeons, and patients.

    The proposed project combines individual patient data with machine-learning algorithms to effectively predict surgical complication risk and improve surgical clinical outcomes. Currently, 13% of 50 million surgical procedures performed in the United States annually result in a surgical complication, half which are potentially avoidable. A primary cause of avoidable complications include significant variable in risk assessment and standardized preventative practice. Therefore, the principal objective of this proposal is to develop machine-learning predictive models of various surgical complications (wound, cardiac, respiratory, renal, etc.), which provides an objective risk assessment for surgeons. Additionally, this risk assessment platform will allow stratification of patients into high- vs. low-risk categories and link patients with risk-appropriate preventative interventions at the point-of-care.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to reduce the necessary supervision and oversight required to operate multiple unmanned platforms in the execution of real-world, specific, task-based activities supporting search and rescue, routine mapping and intelligence gathering missions.  Shifting control from teleoperation to autonomous navigation could enable first responders such as lifeguards, to quadruple their capacity to assist in mass, maritime disaster, rescue scenarios for example. The current practice of a single lifeguard handling 3 victims in a routine riptide incident will be improved by a factor of four, through the use of this technology, allowing lifeguards to better manage mass-scale, maritime disasters that may involve a hundred victims. Human lifeguards could focus on those people requiring immediate personal assistance (unconscious, hypothermia or children for instance), while unmanned maritime platforms could be tasked with responding to clusters of survivors better capable of self-rescue.  Lifeguard assistant robots can also help with the over 400,000 lower profile events in the US each year.  A robot could not only save lives but reduce risk to the lifeguard who typically has to swim or jet-ski out to provide flotation and rescue lines to victims in dangerous conditions.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop increased intelligence and self-awareness for autonomous platforms that will result in an increase in operator ?trust? and allow potential operators who might consider autonomous platforms as ?unreliable? due to potential lost communication links, to have greater confidence in adopting these platforms.  The technology will transition from far field navigation control (such as waypoint based navigation) to a near field control allowing precision delivery of the platform to the desired location in a dynamic environment.  This capability would allow a maritime platform to autonomously drive to a designated cluster of survivors, slow down and behave according to known social proxemics so as not to further stress the victims.  On board, vehicle health monitoring would allow critical system parameters to be reported and broadcast allowing ad-hoc networking with other platforms in the region.  The overall objective would be to optimize the use of resources in any region and to quickly allow multiple lifeguard teams converging on a mass marine casualty event to interact but without having to pre-register or have a priori knowledge of each other?s systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance the impact of precision medicine by simultaneously addressing large-scale medical data aggregation and optimized computation that is cost-effective and to extend the utility of medical informatics well beyond current practice. Patient medical information comes in many diverse forms: genomic sequences, medical images, and clinical observations. The integration of these various data sources across patient populations have shown to reveal patterns and similarities among patients, which inform treatment options. With advances in imaging and genomic sequencing technologies, the sheer volume of available information is growing exponentially, straining current computational approaches, and creating an imminent need for scalable data integration. The ability to overcome this data mountain opens the door to support advanced analytics to support precision medicine and provide enhanced services to medical institutions. With these innovations, patients receive faster and more accurate diagnoses and treatments, clinicians deliver verified treatment decisions through patient cohort comparison, hospitals have better standard of care, and society is overall empowered by supporting global treatment options and well informed pharmaceutical development.

    The proposed project will develop a scalable aggregation and analysis framework to integrate various patient data modalities to inform personalized diagnosis and therapy in precision medicine. Currently, information from different modalities exists in silos, hindering joint analysis and insight. While there has been research trying to leverage machine learning techniques in medical imaging, these efforts have generally focused on a single domain and not been able to integrate facts from other domains. This project will aggregate features from genomics, imaging and clinical characterization of patients into scalable databases and then use a distributed, parallel framework to enable efficient analytics on the resultant joint representation. The resulting platform will enable identification of cohorts based on both genotypes and phenotypes and empower powerful machine learning analyses to inform clinical decision systems or identification of new personalized therapies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit nearly 6 million children per year who are suspected of having abnormal Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) which can lead to a more serious condition with numerous complications referred to as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).  Current detection paradigms include costly and invasive procedures that often require overnight hospitalization, prescribing pharmacological Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) without objective evidence and or exposure to radiological imaging.  The outcomes of this project will lead to a low cost, non-invasive method for detecting GER, without requiring hospitalization.  This will facilitate earlier detection of GER and reduce overall healthcare costs and burdens associated with GERD and its accompanying complications.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of using single point ultrasonic transducers to non-invasively detect and characterize reflux.  Current reflux detection relies on impedance and pH probes which are placed in the patient?s esophagus through a nasogastric probe.  This often requires anesthesia and overnight hospital observation which is costly, invasive, and prone to artifacts that change the reflux episodes normally experienced by the patient.  Ultrasonic imaging can observe reflux occurring in the esophagus but requires hundreds of ultrasonic transducers in a single probe and a trained clinician to manually observe and identify the reflux events.  These two factors make ultrasonic imaging costly to use and prevents it from being used for extended periods of time, which is necessary to determine if abnormal amounts of reflux are occurring.  The proposed project will use ultrasonic imaging as a control method to demonstrate the ability of single point ultrasonic transducers to generate an acoustic signature capable of detecting whether the esophagus is expanded or collapsed to identify episodes of reflux.  Detection and characterization of reflux through single point transducers would ultimately enable the development of a portable, safe, and accurate home monitoring device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to standardize the process of securing and protecting umbilical cord catheters. These catheters are inserted into newborn babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and are used to provide life-saving nutrients and medication directly into their bloodstream. Unfortunately, the infection rate associated with these catheters is among the highest in the healthcare system. There is an important need for a simple medical device that reduces the risk of infection. A reduction in infection rate would save hospitals hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they must currently absorb the cost of treating these infections. Most importantly, reducing umbilical catheter infection rates would save neonatal lives in any hospital setting.

    The proposed project will develop a standardized device that reliably secures umbilical cord catheters and protects the catheter insertion site from various sources of infection. The current standard of care for securing these catheters in NICUs across the United States is a roll of non-sterile tape that offers no protective barrier to the catheter insertion site. This is in stark contrast to medical devices that are used with adult catheters and help prevent bloodstream infections. The research objectives include evaluating different materials, testing the catheter securement mechanism, testing bacterial colonization rates, and evaluating the device?s biosafety for use on neonatal skin. This will be accomplished using custom-built testing rigs and protocols. We anticipate the successful development of a device with material specifications that allow for clinical testing in the NICU.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can lead to a revolution in 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces at the micron-scale. The proposed technology will significantly improve photorealistic rendering and enhance the workflow efficiency in physically-based rendering. This can impact a broad range of industries, including video games, product visualization, animation, visual effects, scientific rendering and virtual/augmented reality. The superior performance and greatly reduced cost will allow the same system to be used in the manufacturing industry, which requires high-resolution depth measurement. This technology will result in the broader adoption of non-contact 3D metrology and 3D machine vision for manufacturing quality control and defect inspection.

    The proposed project will develop a computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot decouple the direct reflection and sub-surface scattering. The goal of this research program is to develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy. The proposed technology is expected to achieve superior performance and greatly reduced cost.

- abstractText: "This NSF SBIR Phase I project takes a unique holistic approach to
    both tumor imaging and cancer drug delivery.  This approach harnesses cancer cell
    proteins already in the body to allow selective delivery of tumor imaging agents
    or cancer-killing drugs to, and into, cancer cells.  By choosing cancer-specific
    targeting proteins, the drugs will be transported primarily into cancer cells
    and undesirable off-target enrichment will be diminished.  The goal is to mitigate
    drug uptake in non-cancerous fast-growing cells like; heart cells, bone marrow,
    skin or hair follicles.  Treated patients will benefit from improved effectiveness
    of their cancer therapies.  Such selective delivery should permit lower dosages
    of drug to be administered while also lowering the risks of unwanted, problematic
    side-effects. This cost-effective approach is well supported by the NSF?s core
    mission for the technical development of innovative drug delivery systems. \n\nIt
    remains challenging to provide sensitive tumor diagnosis and near-simultaneous
    assessments of response to cancer treatments in treated individuals.  Of all the
    standard monitoring modalities, radiographic examination has been the most widely
    used to measure treatment response.  However, some studies suggest up to 10-40%
    of cancers may not be measurable by currently available technologies.  Various
    delivery approaches have been used to take advantage of endogenous molecules to
    transport imaging agents or drugs with increased specificity into cancer cells.
    \ Most of these approaches utilize macromolecular ligands or cell surface receptor
    binding approaches.  This proposal takes a mechanistically innovative small-molecule
    approach.  By harnessing the activities of endogenous inflammatory proteins produced
    in abundance by cancer cells and by cells within the tumor micro-environment,
    small molecule cancer drugs can be transported with efficiency to the site of
    their intended effect.  Selective and accurate placement of a chemically-related
    diagnostic agent into cancer cells should allow a cost-effective, more personalized
    and exceedingly sensitive view of treatment response."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will help establish a commercially viable method for mass production of high-efficiency heat exchangers for the rapid advancement of thermoelectric solar cells and waste heat management. The advancement to be made in this project will help harvest an enormous amount of solar energy and heat energy from the environment. Thermal energy from natural (solar, geothermal etc.) as well as from man-made thermal sources is a continuously available, and currently underutilized resource with the potential to become an important pillar of renewable energy. The solar thermoelectric devices require minimal maintenance and are suitable for deployment in remote regions. The successful completion of this project will significantly improve the performance of solar thermoelectric generators. Besides harnessing solar energy, thermoelectric devices can also be used for waste heat recovery from automobile exhaust and industries using high-temperature furnaces to enhance fuel efficiency and generate electricity for automotive operations. Our estimated outcome can enhance the fuel efficiency of automobile engines by 15-20 %with around $67 billion annual reductions in gasoline expenses and around 570 billion pound reduction in annual carbon emission.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop a disruptive technology to improve the efficiency of thermoelectric devices. Currently, the efficiency of thermoelectric devices is much lower than their theoretical values due to the lack of ideal heat exchanger materials for both hot and cold ends. The research goal is to enhance current module efficiency by more than 90%. The project includes testing and validation of the heat exchanger into thermoelectric generation modules for solar electricity generation and waste heat management from thermal sources at different temperatures, as well as developing methods for mass production of heat exchanger materials. The size of the treated surfaces can be well controlled, making it possible to fabricate microscale solar thermal devices for infrared sensors and night vision cameras.

  title: 'STTR Phase I:  Development of super-efficiency thermoelectric generators
    and waste heat management with black metal and super-wicking surfaces'
- abstractText: |-
    This STTR Phase I project will enable the rapid prototyping and manufacturing of radio frequency (RF) components with 3D printing, and thereby reduce component cost, weight, and turnaround time. The global RF components market is expected to reach $17.54 billion by 2022, but fabrication techniques for commercial RF components have seen little innovation. Conventional RF manufacturing techniques, such machining and photolithography, are accurate and reliable, but they are also expensive, time-consuming and produce unnecessary waste. 3D printing enables fast and accurate manufacturing of custom components, as well as the creation of extremely complex geometries at low-cost for improved component performance. 3D printing can also enable users to design components to fit the design space available, removing the necessity of designing technology around commercially available parts, a critical feature in space and weight-sensitive aerospace applications. However, the materials available to 3D printing are mostly limited to non-conducting polymers. By creating a highly conductive 3D printing material, and testing the properties of RF components made with this filament, this project will make it possible to rapidly prototype and produce custom RF components, thereby accelerating research and improving the competitiveness of RF component manufacturing in the U.S.

    This STTR proposal will create a highly conductive (>2×10^5 S m-1) polymer filament that can be used with low-cost fused deposition modeling 3D printers to create a variety of high-value RF components. The filament will be engineered to print reliably, and retain its conductivity and mechanical integrity to temperatures of ~150 °C. To achieve these goals, the proposed work will determine the relationship between conductivity, the loading of conductive filler, the shape of the conductive filler, the filament mechanical properties, and the viscosity of the filament at printing temperatures. New methods will be developed to prevent oxidation of the conductive filler at elevated temperatures. A novel conductive filler will be developed to achieve these performance specifications at low cost. Concurrent with these material development efforts, novel RF components will be designed, simulated, and printed in order to build a comprehensive database with detailed designs and printing parameters for producing the RF components with a low failure rate. By the end of this project, users will be able to design, predict, and reliably print RF components with conductive filament on low-cost 3D printers.

    This SBIR Phase I project uses artificial intelligence techniques to identify the ways that undergraduate students in scientific courses explicate problems, describe procedures, make claims, provide evidence, offer qualifications, and draw conclusions. With emphasis on forms of scientific reasoning, this new use of artificial intelligence, to identify language patterns associated with scientific reasoning, will allow students to improve their written laboratory reports before they are submitted, therefore freeing instructors to devote precious instructional time to preparing students for roles as practicing scientists. As the U.S. continues to experience rapid diversity growth, this focus on helping students through innovative uses of technology holds the potential to expand science education by cultivating student ability through autonomous writing and revision. Because artificial intelligence techniques are intended to expand capabilities, the techniques being used, available 24/4 on the web, will have the direct impact of growing our technical and scientific workforce, thus expanding the many dynamic pathways to STEM occupations. As the NSF observed in 2015 in its report Revisiting the STEM Workforce, these jobs are extensive and critical to innovation and competitiveness and are essential to the mutually reinforcing goals of individual and national prosperity and competitiveness. An investment in such a technology is thus an investment in national competitiveness, education policy, innovation, and workforce diversity.

    NSF SBIR support will be used to design and launch artificial intelligence techniques based on Deep Artificial Neural Network (DANN) as driven by Natural Language Processing (NLP), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and the latest advances in AI algorithms. Because NLP and LSA techniques are presently used solely to identify grammatical and organizational patterns, the application of DANN is high risk in making a leap from identifying patterns of language use to capturing patterns of scientific reasoning. Trained on a proprietary corpus of 100,000 lab reports scored and annotated by instructors and students using a single rubric, the AI application will identify logic structures of scientific reasoning in student laboratory reports. Once methodically identified, categorized according to ability level, and validated by STEM instructors, digital instruction will be used to help students improve their scientific reasoning processes. With the singular goal of structuring student success through asynchronous machine learning, this innovation holds the promise to figure meaningfully in discussions of national competitiveness, education policy, innovation, and diversity as related to STEM education.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a novel method for synthetic
    oligodeoxynucleotide purification. Currently, most oligodeoxynucleotides are purified
    using chromatography. The techniques are expensive or difficult to scale up, and
    unsuitable for parallel purification of multiple different samples. The proposed
    technology is easy to scale up for large-scale purification and suitable for parallel
    purification. Several areas that require synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides will
    benefit from the technology including oligodeoxynucleotide therapeutics and oligodeoxynucleotides
    used in genome assembly for synthetic biology applications. For therapeutic manufacturing,
    the proposed technology is expected to bring down the cost of production. For
    synthetic biology, the bottleneck is in the area is de novo construction of genomes,
    which requires large numbers of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. Parallel purification
    using the proposed technology will make these materials more affordable. In addition,
    the proposed technology can be readily extended to purify other biooligomers including
    peptides and oligosaccharides. This extension will have a high impact in areas
    such as biomedical research. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to method
    for synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide purification based on the \"catching by polymerization\"
    concept for the purification of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. Currently, most
    synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides are purified using chromatography methods, which
    rely on the rate of speed difference at which product and impurities travel in
    a solid matrix when eluted with solvents for separation. Drawbacks include expensive
    instrumentation, intensive labor, use of large volumes of harmful solvents and
    inability to purify long sequences. This method is expensive to scale up and unsuitable
    for parallel purification. This project aims to commercialize the catching full-length
    sequence by polymerization oligodeoxynucleotide purification technology to solve
    these problems. The method works by selectively tagging a polymerizable group
    to the oligodeoxynucleotide product, polymerizing it into an insoluble polymer,
    washing away all impurities and then cleaving the product from the polymer. Because
    the principle on which the product is separated from impurities is drastically
    different from that of chromatography methods, the proposed technique has many
    advantages, which include no need for expensive instrumentation, simple-to-use,
    low waste to product ratio, and suitability for purification of long sequences.
    Additionally, the new technique is readily scalable for large-scale purification,
    and can be easily adopted for parallel purification."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is to develop an engineered nonmodel yeast platform for
    the economical and sustainable production of natural aroma compounds. High quality
    aroma compounds have a variety of applications, ranging from flavor and fragrance
    to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. With the strong consumer demand for more natural
    alternatives to chemically synthesized ingredients in both food and personal care
    items, the production of these ingredients by fermentation will add a renewable
    source to the supply chain and will reduce demand on botanical sources. This work
    will advance methodologies and knowledge for creating novel microbial cell factories
    via 13C-metabolite tracing, metabolic flux analysis, fermentation optimization,
    and kinetic modeling. The lessons from this research will offer general guidelines
    for overcoming biosynthesis hurdles and optimizing bioprocess operations, and
    will facilitate the development of transferable technologies for inexpensive production
    of diverse natural products that are broadly used for human health and wellness.
    \ \n \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to integrate synthetic biology and bioprocess
    engineering to optimize the microbial strain for the de novo production of natural
    aroma compounds. Because plants carry aroma compounds in extremely low amounts,
    commercial extracts from plants are not economically viable. To overcome these
    challenges, this project will develop a novel fermentation process for production
    of these compounds with high product specificity and yields. Specifically, a nonmodel
    yeast strain will be engineered via PUSH (increase the supply of the precursor
    acetyl-CoA), PULL (overexpress key biosynthetic pathway genes), POWER (enhance
    ATP and NADPH generation) strategies. Further, 13C-metabolic flux analysis will
    be used to rigorously measure in vivo enzyme functions, to delineate acetyl-CoA
    supply/consumption pathways, and to identify metabolic burdens or bottleneck factors.
    Meanwhile, novel simultaneous fermentation and product recovery will be built
    to improve productivity. The fluxome information and fermentation kinetics will
    offer guidelines for rational genetic modifications and bioprocess optimizations.
    Ultimately, this environmentally friendly process would provide a new, reliable
    and natural manufacture scheme to meet the growing demand of consumers for healthier
    products."

    This SBIR Phase I project will research the feasibility of applying virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in manufacturing and material testing training programs to increase academic achievement, accelerate progress toward degree and foster more effective use of expensive lab-equipment.  According to 2014 statistics, in the United States, less than 40% of students entering college in STEM fields finish with a STEM degree. And even for those who finish, a majority (over 60% ) take several years longer than the nominal time of 4 years. Providing students with VR and AR enabled personalized manufacturing labs is a promising way to increase students' engagement and better prepare them for future careers as well as broaden students' outlook on innovation. As described in the recent US council report on competitiveness, advanced manufacturing has the largest multiplier effect on jobs. In order for the US to gain competitiveness in this sector, there is a pressing need for a trained workforce that is able to develop new materials testing protocols and manufacturing processes. This SBIR project aims to develop technologies that enable the education sector to leverage VR and AR to accelerate training. Proposed software will be evaluated through pilot testing. Technology and insights resulting from this project may find applications in other domains such as life sciences.


    Key technical innovations in this proposed research include the development of a novel high-fidelity modular virtual object model, customized task models based on evidence centered design, and methods to flexibly combine object models with task models to rapidly develop activities suitable for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices. These innovations may significantly reduce the content creation cost and potentially dissolve the boundary between classroom education and hands-on training, providing an effective and seamless educational experience. In the long term, these innovations may also be applied broadly to training in other domains. The overarching goal of this SBIR project is to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system for content creation and learning analytics and apply them to create innovative content for use in manufacturing courses. The proposed system and content will be evaluated via pilot testing with engineering students to collect rich datasets comprising videos, sensor time series data and simulation-event logs. Data analysis will seek evidence for changes in both students outcomes (changes in content knowledge, engagement, attitude towards engineering, self-efficacy towards learning engineering, usability of the product) and instructor outcomes (attitudes about the usefulness of the product).

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project aims to develop a novel microfluidic sensor
    technology that can measure blood coagulation times (specifically prothrombin
    time-PT, measured in international normalized ratio-INR) at point-of-care (POC).
    PT/INR has to be monitored frequently for millions of patients on oral Warfarin
    (an anticoagulant that prevents clotting) to keep them in a safe therapeutic range.
    The POC sensor developed in this project is expected to provide PT/INR measurements
    independent of factors influencing the blood counts of the patients, making it
    safer and more accurate. The technological foundation of the proposed research
    is to combine acoustic sensing with microfluidics. The preliminary data demonstrates
    that the proposed sensor can measure viscosity and density of extremely small
    liquid volumes (~ 10 nL) accurately. The successful implementation and commercialization
    of this innovation will result in a big market share in the rapidly growing POC
    coagulation test market and create hundreds of jobs. The research and development
    process during this STTR will also contribute to the full understanding of this
    technology?s potential, which can result in other self/home testing instruments
    for patients. \n\nThe proposed novel coagulation monitor is based on microfluidic
    quartz resonator sensors. Quartz resonator sensors can be used to measure changes
    in fluid viscosity or mass coupled to their surfaces (both of which occur during
    coagulation of blood) by monitoring the associated changes in the resonance frequency.
    The technology underlying quartz resonators is well established, simple and robust,
    and amenable to provide portable and compact instrumentation. The innovation here
    is the integrated microfluidics, which will bring the benefits of extremely low
    liquid volume requirements, control over how liquid is observed by the sensor
    (which can be used to enhance sensor output due to the coagulation), and on-chip
    blood plasma separation. The key objectives of the proposed research are to determine
    the microfluidics design and the surface functionalization that will optimize
    a microfluidic quartz resonator sensor?s coagulation measurement sensitivity,
    and to implement on-chip blood plasma separation for PT/INR measurements."

    Research (SBIR) project will be the development of an instrument to address the
    scaling and regulatory challenges of quality control that increase cost and impede
    large scale deployment of cellular therapies to a wide patient base. Cellular
    therapies taking advantage of engineered human cells have shown incredible potential
    as \"living drugs\" that achieve personalized therapies for cancer patients. Recent
    improvements in these therapies have shown their efficacy in targeting and killing
    specific types of leukemias. In light of these successes, more and more research
    and clinical trials are being proposed to improve current efficacy in treating
    blood cancers and adapting these therapies to other cancers types. While showing
    promise in the fight against cancer, there is growing concern over the manufacturability
    of clinical doses, especially when scaling up to meet global demands. Additionally,
    the speed at which these therapies are being developed is causing regulatory agencies
    to lag behind in terms of quality control and release criteria. Both of these

    control of therapeutic cell batches remains difficult to standardize and scale
    given the plethora of standalone tools needed to adequately characterize each
    batch. This modular approach has high capital cost, high recurring maintenance
    costs, and requires skilled technicians. Ideally, the capabilities of these standalone
    tools can be combined into one automated system to provide standardized metrics
    for cellular therapy quality without user variability. Leveraging well-established
    immunomagnetic cell labeling techniques, ratcheting cytometry is able combine
    the capabilities of quality control tools by individually measuring magnetic content
    and gating based on surface expression. Leveraging these advantages, the goal
    is to demonstrate feasibility for an integrated instrument to quantify cell number,
    viability, surface expression, and cytokine secretion of therapeutic cell batches

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a low cost educational platform which provides students a gateway to understanding and writing software code in modern real-world programming languages. The research addresses a pressing need in the K-12 setting to engage both teachers and students in Coding as a Literacy. Current approaches to teaching computer science and programming principles in K-12 often fail to bridge the gap between block-based graphical representations and text-based programming languages. Strong growth in Maker Spaces within school classrooms and libraries has led to a proliferation of Maker-oriented products in the K-12 setting, but teachers and students alike struggle to understand the software coding required to make meaningful use of them. The project embraces the Maker spirit with an expandable robotics platform that provides fertile ground for lesson development, paired with software that enables step-by-step execution of the student's code over a wireless connection. The commercialization of this technology will augment the effectiveness of STEM initiatives underway in the nation?s schools, keep students engaged in more advanced computer programming as they transition into middle and high school levels, boost the enrollment in technical disciplines at the University level, and ultimately increase the technology-related global competitiveness of the national workforce.

    The goal of this project is to overcome current limitations in microcontroller-based software development, with specific focus on the enablement of interactive debugging capabilities without the use of "target monitor" hardware external to the microcontroller itself. The project includes both software and hardware development efforts, as the research is directed at enabling a highly integrated system through the use of state-of-the-art silicon technology designed for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The advent of these System on Chip (SoC) integrated circuits brings the potential for a radically lower cost, IP-connected educational technology platform. The hardware aspect of the project will include development of a printed circuit board (PCB) assembly leveraging a wireless SoC to provide a Wi-Fi connected robotic computing platform with an expandable circuit interface and a complement of built-in peripherals designed for educational applications. The software will provide a web-based user interface seamlessly integrated with the hardware platform to enable a level of interactive coding not previously seen on a wireless SoC. The commercialized product resulting from this project will leverage this interactive debugging user experience to teach real-world programming language development skills.

The novel products will be sold to famers through already-developed delivery systems primarily through agricultural distributors and seed companies. They are expected to increase plant root development, crop yields and tolerance/resistance to drought and other adverse conditions. The products can be used equally well by large and sophisticated farmers and seed companies, including those using advanced plant genetic traits, but is also adaptable to smaller growers since the input costs to users will be less than competitive technologies for especially coping with adverse environmental stresses. These tools and advances will assist is overcoming the adverse effects of climate change and provide technologies to maximize scarce water resources.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to formulate the active chemicals to provide user-friendly products for delivery in suitable agricultural systems including seed treatments and augmented fertilizers, and to evaluate prototype products on their advantages in the greenhouse, pilot scale and field trial systems. The field trials will be conducted under conditions of drought stress and will permit measurement of water use efficiency of conventional and advanced drought tolerant corn hybrids in the presence and absence of the new products, and will provide a means to determine the mechanism by which the active chemicals provide improvements in plant performance. This third goal is essential since the chemicals as applied are present only during seed germination, but enhance plant performance throughout the season. The formulations are based on novel systems that will sequester volatile active chemicals but release them only when seeds are germinating. The plant performance characteristics that will be measured include enhanced root development throughout the season, enhanced yield parameters under water limiting conditions, and measure water use efficiency.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project will be to digitize the human sense of smell and develop
    a platform to create \"humanized mice\" that that express any human odorant sensor
    in the nose of a mouse.  Tools have been developed to determine the unique odor
    codes for each individual odor mixture that exists today ranging from the fragrances
    in a perfumer's palette to the Chardonnay in your wine cellar. Such an olfactory
    code will allow flavor and fragrance companies to predict the \"smell\" of certain
    odor mixtures, and to engineer new compounds in a rational and more streamlined
    manner. This technology will have a significant commercial impact on existing
    consumer products, including food, personal hygiene, household products, and perfumes,
    by offering a solution to more efficiently design pleasing scents and flavors
    or to formulate compounds that block repulsive odors. In addition, the proposed
    chemical detector platform under development to generate this olfactory code has
    additional applications as a biosensor. It may be used to generate disease-specific
    chemosignatures identified in bodily fluids like urine, sweat or blood, which
    may have application in clinical diagnostics and biomarker discovery. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to use human odor sensors produced in their native
    environment, an olfactory sensory neuron, and develop an ex vivo biochemical assay
    to screen for odor sensor activation in a quantitative way. Since human odor sensors
    (odorant receptors) have proven to be exceptionally difficult to express in vitro,
    high-throughput screening of odorants using conventional pharmaceutical methods
    have not been possible to date. As such, only 10% of all human odorant sensors
    have been linked to their single odor. The preliminary data show that the in vivo
    expression of human odor sensors in mouse olfactory sensory neurons are functional.
    The objective of this project is to show that in vivo expressed odor sensors,
    when removed from their biological model system, maintain their functionality
    (i.e., ex vivo). A secondary objective is to demonstrate that several types of
    odor receptors, each with an accepted odor profile, will respond as predicted
    when analyzed ex vivo using a biochemical assay measuring direct activation of
    odorant receptors. Successful assay development will allow the generation of a
    viable platform that may be expanded with additional odor receptors to further
    decode human olfaction."

    Research (SBIR) project is to develop a detection technology that enables scientists
    and researchers to better understand biological particles circulating in biofluids.
    This improved understanding would lead to new disease diagnostics that could improve
    patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The technology being developed allows
    high-throughput detection and characterization of exosomes, which are nanovesicles
    produced by cells and released in all biological fluids (e.g., blood, saliva,
    and urine). Exosomes are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including
    cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without
    the need of invasive tissue biopsies.  Early detection of disease from a simple
    blood or urine test allows discovery of disease at an earlier point making treatments
    more effective and reduces the need for costly and invasive procedures that could
    cause further complications. Furthermore, the same technology being developed
    also may be used to aid in the manufacturing of next-generation therapeutics that
    use exosomes to combat cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.
    \n \nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a customer-configurable cartridge
    that will allow customization of biological probes to identify and measure specific
    populations of exosomes based on their surface markers. Exosomes, which are nanoparticles
    (50-200 nm) shed by cells into biological fluids, are being investigated for early
    detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative
    disorders. Exosomes, which are biologically active, may be found at high concentrations
    compared to other biomarkers, but their small size makes them very difficult to
    characterize with current techniques. This proposal is to create a high-throughput
    platform to address exosome characterization requirements through two development
    aims: 1) Develop, validate, and demonstrate a disposable microfluidic device that
    will allow customers to configure the assay for characterization of specific populations
    of exosomes, and 2) enable robust detection and identification of the smallest
    populations of low-index exosome nanoparticles, down to 50 nm, allowing complete
    exosome sizing in a high-throughput platform. The completion of these objectives

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make the solar industry even more sustainable by reducting long term potential environmental impact. With the rapid deployment of solar modules, recycling of end-of-life modules will become a necessity in 15 years. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that end-of-life modules will appear in large quantities by the early 2030's and by 2050 they will total 78 million tonnes. Today most end-of-life modules end up in landfills. More importantly, this project will develop a technology to enable a profitable recycling business without any government support, financial and/or legislative. IRENA predicts a new industry worth $15 billion by 2050 from recycling 78 million tonnes of modules. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology has the potential to generate $60 billion in revenue from 78 million tonnes of modules.

    The proposed project develops sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells and modules. The focus of the project is to recover all the valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, lead, copper, tin, aluminum, and glass. It will be demonstrated that the recovered silicon meets the specifications of solar-grade silicon and the recovered metals are over 99% pure. The target for solar-grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially silver, is over 90%. The chemicals for recycling will be carefully chosen so their wastes neutralize each other for a minimal environmental impact.

    The NanoContTM drug delivery technology is a manufacturing platform that uses
    patent protected product specific formulation and process conditions to create

    and long-term product stability, as well as preventing downstream problems, such
    as inconsistent bioavailability and/or dosing. The NanoContTM platform is expected
    to be a disruptive technology because it offers strictly controlled particle size/size

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a simple to use "smoke alarm" for water appliances coupled with a level of insight into water consumption and failures that has never existed before. What was once a reliance on water meter data for the sum of all appliances is now a detailed understanding for each individual water fixture. This unprecedented access to water usage data at an individual appliance level will provide the opportunity for increased data analytics research, predictive analytics for failure modes and maintenance scheduling, and better understanding of human consumption habits to identify and solve problems that allow organizations to meet aggressive sustainability goals.  Only recently has there been an ability for hospitals to aggregate their medical information to aid research efforts to treat and cure chronic diseases and illnesses.  Mobius is looking to do the same for any building owner for water, as the growing concern to continued, reasonable costing fresh water becomes even greater.

    The proposed project will provide the opportunity for the development of an IoT Smart Water Management System (SWMS). It will use artificial intelligence and machine learning to both identify leaks so they can be corrected before wasting precious water and energy, and provide predictive analytics for actionable insights. This will significantly improve water appliance maintenance and prevent costly water damage to properties. Further, at a macro level, it provides municipality level insight for maintenance and crisis management. The vision is to easily install these SWMS devices into any existing water fixture. It will take less than 60 seconds to install and connect to the Internet. The design goal is to be cost-effective from the start. The SWMS provides an affordable and easy way to adopt data driven decision making into current operations. The critical objectives set forth in this proposal are centered on achieving a simple "smoke alarm" like warning of a fault coupled with a robust analytics platform.  Finally, these will be designed as highly durable IoT devices that require little or no maintenance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is many-fold. The novel photosensor technology developed within this project will enable a new generation of ultrasensitive experiments in the broad field of astroparticle physics?designed and constructed on previously impossible scales This technology is advantageous as detectors of ultrahigh energy cosmic radiation, neutrinos, dark matter and more. In addition, our technology addresses societal needs, including advancements in medical imaging and nuclear security. In medical application, the same core technology can enable the production of cost-effective ultrasensitive whole-body-enclosing medical scanners (patent pending) for preventive, virtually harmless (low-dose) cancer screening of the symptom-free population (a currently non-existent service). For nuclear security application, this technology can enable widespread and cost-effective detection of illicit fissionable and radioactive materials (also a currently non-existent possibility). In general, this project can lead to the creation of a highly profitable and multi-faceted hi-tech industry.

    The proposed project will meet the needs of our lead customer/partner, an international collaboration aiming at the detection of cosmic neutrino radiation at the South Pole site with unprecedentedly high sensitivity. Such sensitivity will be achieved in a volume of 10km^3 of ice, instrumented with 2500 m deep chains of detectors, and only a detector concept and cost-effective hi-tech production method like ours can reach that goal. However, harsh conditions at the experimental site require specific modifications to the core design of our invention. Pairs of modified photosensors will need to be packed into each detector unit, which will be electrically grounded on its surface, so the standard high-voltage connection must be swapped with the ground-potential. Consequently, the photodiode will be moved from the middle to the periphery, and specially designed light pipes will bring the light to them. At the same time, we will design a high-voltage power supply that will be integrated within the narrow spacing between the two photosensors. Additionally, this assembly must operate at -70 oC. Therefore, we will produce modified photosensors, design and produce all the additional components and interfaces, test the detectors under near-realistic conditions, and share them with our customer/partner for further evaluation and feedback.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in a significant improvement in the performance, power, and cost of deploying smart computer vision applications. This improvement will simplify the deployment of smart vision applications in automotive, sports and entertainment, consumer, robotics and machine vision, medical, and security/surveillance domains. Through a unique and energy-efficient hardware computation platform, automated hardware design for machine learning applications, and efficient implementation libraries, this project will improve both the feature set and efficiency of smart vision applications across a wide range of end-use cases. With the rapid growth in smart vision applications, this project will be a key enabling technology to support high-performance, energy efficient and scalable solutions. Internet of Things (IoT) applications promise to produce billions in revenue and trillions in global economic impact through improved efficiency, safety, energy, and labor costs. Wide deployment of customized computing in IoT applications will lead to substantial energy savings, and a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions, and a more sustainable growth model for deployment of intelligent sensor systems with thousands or millions of sensor nodes analyzing large volumes of input data.
    The proposed project focuses on the design of high performance, energy-efficient IoT computer vision platforms, design tools, and implementation libraries. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive design and implementation platform to meet performance and energy goals; however, there are two main challenges to their adoption (1) small FPGAs are cost-effective but insufficient to replace the efficient, low-cost ASICs for computation-demanding applications; large FPGAs can fulfill all computation demands, but are too expensive to meet IoT price points, and (2) design and development for FPGAs is challenging and require hardware design expertise. This project?s innovation targets these challenges. First, our proposed platform will combine a media ASIC for efficient video processing with a small cost-effective FPGA for custom machine learning. Second, our proposed domain specific high level synthesis will generate efficient machine learning accelerators for standard machine learning infrastructures quickly, limiting required hardware design expertise while out-performing general purpose design techniques. This project will leverage background expertise in hardware design, design tools, and machine learning to develop and demonstrate the advantages of hybrid computation platforms for smart vision applications in terms of performance, energy consumption, cost and physical size.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in addressing blood clots in the pulmonary
    artery. Venous thrombosis, comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
    embolism (PE), occurs with an incidence of approximately 1 per 1000 annually in
    adult populations. Estimates suggest that 60k -100k Americans die of DVT/PE (also
    called venous thromboembolism). The current treatments are high risk to the patients
    and very expensive to the health care systems. Current treatment methods involve
    the use of systemic or catheter-directed thrombolytic medications to break down
    the clot and restore blood flow. The use of these medications carries the risk
    of bleeding in different parts of the body which can lead to death. Open-heart
    surgery is another treatment method, but the high risk of this critical surgery
    requires highly skilled physicians and advanced equipment that may not be available
    in most hospitals. The proposed device is simple and intuitive and allows the
    physicians to complete the treatment and restore the blood flow in less than 30
    minutes of the patient arrival while other treatment methods take several hours
    for mechanical thrombectomy and several days for catheter-delivered thrombolysis.
    This will significantly reduce the total procedure cost by reducing the length
    of stay in the intensive care unit from the average of 2-3 days to only a few
    hours. \n\nThe proposed project advances the current of the art of Nitinol medical
    device design, fabrication, and evaluation. The proposed clot removal device targets
    pulmonary embolism which is a common disease and may lead to death. The proposing
    team has established the technologies and know-how to produce the core Nitinol
    components of device. These include a simulation-based design optimization methodology,
    which has been used for the design of the main blood clot capturing funnels from
    Nitinol. The team has established innovative non-conventional fabrication and
    post-processing heat treatment procedures. Based on the anatomy and functionality
    of the circulation system an innovative test set up has been fabricated that can
    replicate the blockage of arteries. To this end, human blood clots are created
    and inserted in the test apparatus for a later retrieval. One of the main innovations
    is a Nitinol structure designed to allow for a 7-fold increase in the diameter
    of the blood capturing device when deployed: when deployed these Nitinol elements
    can expand from 2mm to 14mm in diameter, without any balloon or other external
    force. This innovative functionality has never been achieved before and is essential
    for the atraumatic functionality of the proposed device. This has been achieved
    by developing a mathematical method to systematically calculate the shape and
    size of laser cutting feature on a tube of Nitinol. With proper heat treatment,
    this tube can be formed to produce the two capturing baskets. The team has also
    used additive manufacturing and advanced computer simulation to create a test
    setup for in vitro testing of the capturing device."

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will enable
    video-rate three-dimensional (3D) imaging within two-photon microscopes (TPMs)
    through the use of an electrostatically actuated deformable membrane mirror (DMM).
    As a subset of laser scanning microscopes (LSMs), TPMs achieve very high spatial
    resolution by using a focused, high-power laser beam to excite fluorescence via
    the simultaneous absorption of two low energy infrared photons to stimulate emission
    in the visible. Because of the increased resolution, and increased penetration
    of infrared light into tissue compared with other LSM methods, TPMs have become
    widely accepted for use in the medical industry, specifically for dermatology
    and neurology. The technology developed for this project will address the $500
    million LSM market by delivering a low-cost, electrically tunable optic capable
    of simultaneously controlling focus and aberrations while operating an order of
    magnitude faster than competitive technologies. The 3D imaging capabilities enabled
    by this technology will result in an advancement of microscopy techniques and
    diagnostic methods, thereby reducing diagnostic time and patient discomfort. Other
    markets that can easily be addressed by this technology include laser marking
    and engraving, endoscopes, optical coherence tomography, and machine vision. \n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this project will be the development of high-power capable
    coatings for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based deformable mirrors.
    Because these mirrors consist of a thin membrane with a reflective surface, standard
    glass coating processes for solid substrates are incompatible. Instead, the surface
    material for the mirror must be deposited within one of the many fabrication steps
    for the DMM. This project will address the unique challenges of developing high-reflectance
    coatings and incorporate them into the existing DMM fabrication process. The project
    involves four key objectives: 1) developing gold coated deformable mirrors, 2)
    developing protected silver coated deformable mirrors, 3) measuring key performance
    parameters, and 4) measuring and defining the power handling capability and damage
    thresholds of gold and silver DMMs. The anticipated result will be a fully characterized
    DMM capable of long operation under the high-power femtosecond laser illumination
    regime used in two photon microscopes."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of applications, including smart buildings, home automation, and security. The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditions automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars cost saving from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions, making positive contribution to the planet?s climate and environment. In addition to "smart building"/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law enforcement/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This projects represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in the underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count, and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors (TruePODS) in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.

    This STTR Phase I project will study the storage of hydrogen on a novel material produced from silicon - the same substance used to make solar panels and computer chips. This unique and patented approach has the potential to eclipse all prior methods of hydrogen storage in terms of pressure, temperature, safety, cost, and convenience. Silicon is earth-abundant and benign to humans - it is even promotes healthy skin, hair, and fingernails. The implication of hydrogen-in-silicon is that fuel cell-powered vehicles, homes, and electronics can be far more efficient and clean than any other source of energy. Of great significance is that this technology will allow homeowners and businesses to generate their own hydrogen by splitting water using rooftop solar panels. By storing this as hydrogen-in-silicon a home can be run overnight or for many days during a cloudy spell. Hydrogen can replace the batteries in portable electronics so they can last up to 20 days without a recharge - far longer than with batteries. And if the rooftop system is of sufficient size, one can produce the hydrogen needed for a fuel cell vehicle, such as those already on the market. The implications of this are far-reaching, allowing complete energy independence for all, for all time to come, with minimal environmental impact and using almost completely renewable and low-cost resources which are easy to recycle.


    Porous silicon is easy to synthesize but requires a catalyst to recharge from a gaseous source. The introduction of the catalyst is critical as it must be controlled spatially and positioned to effect spillover onto and off of silicon. Density Functional Theory studies show this is energetically favorable and first-order macroscopic calculations indicate that recharge can be effected in 3.5 minutes at 8 bar and 250 C. The overall energy difference between fully-charged and fully-discharged silicon-hydrogen is an amazingly low 1 kcal/mol. The energy barrier is the strong H-H bond which dominates the kinetics. The course of this project is to strategically place palladium atoms at specific sites on the matrix of porous silicon so that it can mediate the H-H bond energy and allow spillover onto the 800 m^2/gm surface area of microporous silicon. This has been patented but never demonstrated in the laboratory, which is why this funding from NSF is needed. A further goal of this work is to demonstrate the viability of low-cost silicon using metallurgical grade material instead of the single-crystal silicon which has been used to date.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a safety system for improving the quality and
    reducing the cost of dementia care. Alzheimer's disease affects 5.4M in the US,
    including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two thirds of all
    those affected by dementia. Despite that Alzheimer's disease is the single most
    expensive disease in the US and falls are the leading cause of hospitalization
    in Alzheimer's care, current tools offer little support. Although 3/4 of elderly
    fallers will experience a repeat fall, solutions like bed alarms and wearable
    fall detection systems offer no way to see how falls occur. Care staff have no
    way of learning from the first fall to reduce the likelihood of the second and
    must implement painful and expensive policies such as sending every unwitnessed
    fall to the emergency room in case a hit to the head occurred. \n\nThe proposed
    project addresses this critical gap in Alzheimer's care by detecting falls based
    on camera video where falls can be reviewed by a human assistant in real-time
    and after the fact. Real-time review allows for instant notification if a hit
    to the head occurred, and review after the fact allows for determining the cause
    of the fall to see if changes in room layout and/or policy could be made. The
    primary aim of this project is to collect video data of real falls 1) to apply
    and extend state-of-the-art deep learning methods to perform high accuracy detection
    and 2) to validate that affected individuals, family, and care staff are accepting
    of a camera-based solution. Fall detection will be performed by extending the
    Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) algorithm using domain adaptation
    techniques developed to robustly handle night-vision camera operation, occlusion,
    and non-standard human pose. Technical success will be measured by <1% missed
    detection and <50% false positive rate from this feasibility study. This first
    accuracy threshold will define a lower bound where, as has been demonstrated repeatedly
    in the deep-learning paradigm, accuracy will continue to improve as more data
    is collected."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve and automate cognitive health screening mechanisms used in hospital facilities, by designing and validating a smart chair and a smart wearable based health data-centric novel solution. U.S. population has more than 16 million people (this is rapidly growing further) living with cognitive impairment. There is alarming fact that people with cognitive impairment report more than three times as many hospital stays as individuals with other health conditions. These are driving development of improved cognitive health assessment solutions, that will detect subtle signs of cognitive decline early in daily life. Motivated by these markets in demand, this project is designed to develop a system for advanced and remote screening and monitoring of cognitive health, and also enabling gamified user interaction for cognitive rehabilitation. The developed technology has large potential to help elderly people prone to levels of dementia (from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease), and slowly rehabilitating patients dealing with cognitive decline (stroke survivors and cancer patients under treatment). The designed platform and cognitive scoring algorithms developed in this project will be tested and validated with real patient study at hospital facility.


    The proposed project is a research, development and clinical studies effort to design and validate an advanced and remote screening, monitoring and rehabilitation solution for cognitive health. Such cognitive health management system will be achieved by technological innovation in multi-modal sensing and machine learning based behavioral data analytics from a smart chair and a custom wearable device (used separately), along with cognitive psychology driven gamified interactions and interventions. The smart chair system will capture patient non-verbal response and stress patterns, when answering to cognitive questionnaire. The smart wearable system (used with a few custom Bluetooth beacons in proximity) will analyze normalcy, forgetfulness, confusion in patient, while performing daily life cognitive tasks (such as baking a cake or cookie) in home-like kitchen facility in hospital. The main research objective includes two novel cognitive health scoring mechanism from user response with chair based cognitive questionnaire, and wearable based cognitive task performance quality. It will also design user interactions and interventions for cognitive rehabilitation and behavior reinforcement. This is a very impactful project with team's direct ongoing collaboration with hospital and neurologist, and access to large number of patients with range of cognitive disabilities (in accordance with IRB and HIPAA compliance).

    This STTR Phase I project looks to create a solution to the vast problem that hernia has become in the United States by developing a system that prevents hernia before it occurs. There are an estimated 300,000 hernia repairs performed each year in the US. Incisional hernia (IH) occurs in up to 70% in high-risk populations. The hernia epidemic is significant and is linked to reduced quality of life and $3.2 billion/year in healthcare expenditures for hernia repair. IH can be prevented using prophylactic mesh, which involves placement of tensioned mesh to reinforce abdominal fascia closures before herniation occurs. Prophylactic mesh has been shown to reduce the risk of IH from 35.9% to 1.5%. However, although prophylactic mesh produces outstanding results, it has not become widely adopted in part due to the technical challenge that the procedure poses and added operative time. This project aims to create a system that makes the prophylactic mesh procedure simpler, more reliable, and faster. This project offers an efficient solution to the hernia epidemic by addressing key surgeon-level barriers to adoption of prophylactic mesh and therefore will foster more widespread use of the procedure. Broader use of hernia prevention will improve outcomes, quality of life, and reduce the costs associated with IH.

    This project proposes the development of a hand-held system that simplifies and reduces the time to perform prophylactic mesh augmentation by integrating multiple discrete operative tasks including locating, tensioning, and affixing mesh onto the abdominal fascia. The system provides an optimized strategy for prophylactic mesh placement by leveraging biomechanical principles of both the abdominal wall and mesh to provide a quick, standardized, and reliable method to strengthen abdominal incisions and as a result minimize the risk of herniation. The system is comprised of three main components: the applicator, the fastener-anchor, and the mesh itself. The fastener-anchor represents a core functionality of the technology while serving two purposes: (1.) interaction/engagement and subsequent tension-setting of the mesh via the applicator system; and (2.) penetration of the fascia and affixation of the mesh onto the fascia. The applicator is a simple, ergonomic tool that interfaces with the fastener-anchors, allowing the surgeon to control the spatial position, tension, and placement of the mesh. This project aims to accomplish two main goals: (1.) to refine the device design, including achieving optimal security and reliability of engagement between the applicator and the fastener-anchors and (2.) to assess the biomechanical strength and speed of the proposed technology compared to current standards of care. Through iterative device prototyping, testing, and refinement, a fully functional device will be developed.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a hyper-personalized, clinical,

    transfusions, transfusion-related complications, and transfusion related expenditures.
    Blood transfusions are the most commonly prescribed medical procedure in the US,
    and cost our healthcare system $30 billion annually. The cost of unnecessary transfusions
    is estimated at no less than $15 billion each year. These figures double when

    clinical evidence-driven decision support system that would empower the physician
    with a near real-time laboratory, clinical, diagnostic and prognostic information,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the alleviation of several current difficulties in the growth measurement of many bacterial species, especially anaerobic and other fastidious organisms. A large number of these species are naturally occurring in the human body, and they have recently been shown to play critical roles in allergies, autoimmune diseases, dietary health, cancer, infection response, and more. The study of these species is considered by many to be the next frontier of modern medicine, especially as current approaches to managing infectious diseases, such as traditional antibiotics, appear to be losing effectiveness. However, current measurement technology is largely incompatible with the specialized environments and chambers in which anaerobic organisms must be grown. There is therefore a large unmet need for better ways to measure anaerobic bacterial growth; this need is growing quickly as interest in the field increases. The ability to conduct high-throughput experiments in specialized environments will become critical as research into various human microbiomes accelerates, and demand for high-volume data grows. The existing market for high-throughput measurement devices is at least $300 million and growing; the proposed technology will expand that market to fields it has never served.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop technology for measuring growth of many bacterial samples in a format much smaller than currently available high-throughput devices. The rise of systems and computational biology demonstrates a growing demand for large amounts of quantitative data; the variety of microbes in the human body necessitates such an approach. However, this type of data is currently nearly impossible to collect in anaerobic and other specialized environments. This project aims to bring high-throughput growth measurement techniques to these environments by creating simplified, miniaturized hardware paired with advanced real-time analysis and control software. The project?s first objective is to refine a novel proof-of-concept optical density measurement method to achieve accuracy and precision comparable to traditional techniques, and verify using bacterial growth and inorganic liquid testing. The next goal is to design a hardware enclosure small and robust enough to allow compatibility with the smallest and most taxing environments. Finally, software will be developed to manage a high number of bacterial experiments (and devices) running in parallel without sacrificing data fidelity or high resolution. It is anticipated that the resulting high-throughput measurement system will greatly expand researchers' abilities to characterize microbes of increasing clinical relevance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to investigate the feasibility of developing a novel clinical genomics software analysis platform that may help reduce or eliminate some of the most significant challenges associated with genetic testing. In the US, genomics plays a role in 9 of the 10 leading causes of death including cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. As such, genetic testing is growing very rapidly, as are some of the associated challenges of scale, performance, cost and quality.  Genomic medicine and genetic testing are key underpinnings of precision medicine, which may help lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and even prevention of complex diseases and disorders. This feasibility study targets the development of an advanced analysis software platform to address analysis bottlenecks and ultimately improve time-to-treatment. The team will determine feasibility based on prototyping key technologies and methods to address current state limitations and point towards an improved future-state approach.  The study will be done in close collaboration with actual clinical genomics users to deliver clear and compelling benefits to the target market and end-users and to provide a high-value solution to the rapidly growing market segment.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to design and prototype a novel genomics software analysis platform.  It will include access to a large work bench of bioinformatics applications and performance optimized clinical analysis workflows running on scalable public cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant computing infrastructure. The platform will be developed following the software-as-a-service model, designed to optimize performance and costs for next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. The project will entail development of advanced proprietary computational algorithms to parallelize execution of analysis tasks, and the creation of highly optimized genomics analysis workflows. These workflows will result in dramatic time-savings as well as reduced costs compared to current state approaches. Project efforts also will focus on the development of sophisticated resource provisioning logic to exploit scale and cost optimization running on public cloud infrastructure. In addition, the project will include the feasibility of developing a dual-purpose platform for R&D and clinical usage for faster testing and adoption of newer and advanced tools and procedures. The technology will help to improve patient care by delivering results substantially faster, with higher quality and at lower cost. Additionally, users will be able to construct and validate custom analysis workflows that meet HIPAA, CLIA-CAP, and other clinical requirements.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the ability to quickly and easily identify
    fall-risk in an aging population. Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal
    injuries in older adults, resulting in loss of independence and financial burden
    (predicted to exceed $54 and $101 billion in 2020 and 2030). There is a critical
    need for a diagnostic and prognostic tool that can be utilized in large cohorts
    in a cost-effective manner. Identifying fall risk before a fall occurs is critical
    for timely deployment of preventive measures, but also so that limited resources
    can be allocated to those who are most likely to experience a fall. This, in turn,
    will ultimately reduce the number of falls, prolong independent living for the
    elderly population, and reduce healthcare costs. Following completion of the project,
    the device will be a commercially viable product which will lead to the growth
    and expansion of a start-up company. \n\nThe proposed project will optimize and
    demonstrate the technical feasibility of an innovative balance and gait assessment
    device that provides a measure of fall-risk. Primary care physicians report that
    they do not have the knowledge and time to complete fall-risk assessments. Thus,
    this project will optimize and validate a fall-risk assessment device that can
    be easily implemented in multiple settings, including retirement communities,
    health clinics, and physician offices. The first objective of this project is
    to optimize and validate the balance assessment capabilities of the device, as
    the gait assessment capabilities have already been validated. The device will
    be compared concurrently with a device commonly used in research labs. The second
    objective is to validate the device with balance-compromised populations; as in
    the first objective, the device will be compared concurrently with a device commonly
    used in research labs. The third objective is to establish that the device provides
    a biomarker for age and disease by demonstrating that the balance and/or gait
    parameters are different across three groups (young adults, older adults, and
    people with Parkinson's disease)."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the development of a confocal optical microscope with two-dimensional topographical profiling and multiple spectroscopic modes in a single, affordable precision instrument. The system will make a major impact in the $6.2 billion microscope market, with a near-term market penetration potential of over 5%, and significant growth potential. This technology will span the needs of materials science research laboratories through quality control in manufacturing to supply chain monitoring. Integration of topographic mapping with a diverse set of spectroscopic tools enables comprehensive materials analysis at the micron and submicron scale. Users will be able to identify features and defects in electronic, optoelectronic, and structural devices, as well as coatings, tubing, devices, disks, and specialty mirrors. Combinatorial materials and chemical research will also be furthered by the ability to acquire several spectroscopic maps with a single instrument. Societal impacts include practical improvements in the design and manufacture of components and systems.  Because of its compact size and low cost, the microscope can be used in schools at all levels, providing students with experience in measuring properties of complex objects and helping prepare them for careers in various research, development, and production settings.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on the advancement of optical microscopy into the realm of spectroscopic and surface analysis of topographically complex structures. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), for example, have micron-to-millimeter features that can be analyzed by the developed instrument. The key innovation is the development of precision profiling and its integration with multiple spectroscopic interrogation methods. This profiling innovation centers on the capture of two-dimensional optical images with an array detector from each point on a sample and the conversion of the image properties to a vertical focus error, which is then corrected in a subsequent spectroscopic scan. The instrument can then provide Raman, photoluminescence (PL), and topographic surface (morphology) mapping of a sample, with diffraction-limited resolution. Research objectives include integration of optical profiling with spectroscopic scanning to produce accurate two-dimensional spectra from topographically rough samples, and automation of the image capture and analysis software. The instrument is designed to capture the surface topography and spectrum of a sample with tens of thousands of sample points in a few minutes and with 10-50 nanometer vertical accuracy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the expansion of autonomous unmanned aerial systems (UAS, or drones) to new maritime operational environments and commercial markets. The proposed technology will enable small UAS to operate from vessels moving at sea, without the need for a dedicated pilot or installed hardware, even while far from shore and beyond the reach of established communication networks. Small UAS can offer the same aerial perspective provided by manned helicopters at a fraction of the size, cost, and risk. Real-time aerial imagery from UAS will supply maritime operators with invaluable information about their surroundings at sea, which is not available by any other means. This information is critical for many maritime applications, including fishing, ocean monitoring, scientific exploration, maritime surveillance, and search, and rescue. This information will offer a particularly large and immediate impact for 98% of worldwide commercial fishing vessels (those that do not carry embarked manned helicopters for fish-finding) by dramatically reducing their fuel costs; providing net economic and environmental gains for the industry.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop algorithms and software to enable small UAS autonomously and reliably land onto a moving platform at sea. Commercially-available small UAS can offer invaluable real-time aerial imagery for maritime operators. But, this technology is not currently in widespread use due to technological barriers. In particular, the key enabling technology is the ability to autonomously and reliably land a small UAS onto a moving platform. The research objective is to develop algorithms and software that enable small UAS to autonomously operate from moving vessels at sea. Computer vision algorithms automatically detect the host vessel and the dedicated landing area. Data fusion algorithms estimate the relative drone-boat position and orientation in real time, including compensation for vessel roll, pitch, & heave. Precision control algorithms optimize the drone?s trajectory for save, reliable, autonomous launch and landing. A prototype system will be built by integrating the STTR-developed software with commercially available hardware components.

    even a 10% improvement in efficiency in radiologists' performance would translate
    to ~$900 million savings to the overall health care budget. Finally, an indirect,

    is being generated by hundreds of new medical devices. \n\nThe proposed project
    concerns the seamless integration of a patient Identification system in hospitals
    to improve patient safety and radiology throughput. The intellectual merit of
    this work is a transformative approach overcoming the failure of existing patient

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will generate a new nanoparticle characterization system with the ability to assess the size, length-to-width ratio, zeta potential, and concentration of solution-based nanoparticle (or molecular) samples with state-of-the-art accuracy, precision, and resolution, all on a single platform. The primary need for new nanoparticle characterization instrumentation is driven by the increasing utility and benefit of nanoparticles in healthcare and medicine, including nanoparticle drug delivery, nanoscale particle/molecule drugs and therapies, and nanoparticle-based imaging and diagnostics agents. The prototype system developed under this program will be targeted toward the general nanoparticle characterization market, presently estimated at ~$500M, which includes applications in the pharmaceutical and biomedical industries, nanoparticle manufacturing, R&D, and academic research. The developed system will not only improve solution-based nanoparticle characterization, but streamline characterization processes and provide new insights with regard to sample characterization, optimization, and utilization within the nanoparticle field.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development of a completely new and innovative particle characterization system for which there is no equivalent, capable of automated, high-resolution, solution-based particle assessments at the single-molecule level.  The developed system will enable the ability to quickly characterize a large number (hundreds to thousands) of particles/molecules in solution in order to assess the distribution within the sample. These goals will be reached by developing, building, and validating a complete and fully functioning alpha-prototype system and then demonstrating the functionality and utility of the new system by characterizing solution-based particle- and molecule-containing samples that otherwise cannot be characterized with high resolution. Upon completing this program, an entirely new nanoparticle characterization instrument will be developed and validated that is ready for initial introductions into the nanoparticle field via industrial and academic communities.

    a research program to prepare new materials for a novel sensor to detect when
    a water softener needs regeneration. The adoption of a low cost, accurate water
    hardness sensor can drive a substantial reduction in both the amount of salt released
    into municipal sewer systems and the amount of water used to rinse the resins.
    The patent-pending hardness sensor can replace more expensive and less effective
    components and approaches that are currently utilized by water softeners to initiate
    regeneration. This will enable penetration into markets which have been underserved
    due to environmental concerns about salt discharge. Manufacturers of softeners
    will benefit from the proposed hardness sensor, because it will modernize their
    regeneration controls while also improving water softening efficiency and environmental
    sustainability. Annual global water softener sales growth is around 8%. With a
    15-20% market penetration, sensor sales could be around $90 million (water softener
    model). The proposed development of ion-exchange fibers is expected to have applications
    beyond hardness sensors. The same approach can be used to make anion-exchange
    fibers that can be employed for the detection of nitrate in devices similar to
    softeners to remove nitrate from drinking water. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this project is the development of a new method for making ion-exchange fibers.
    The proposed work will build upon past research performed and will culminate in
    the development of commercially available cation-exchange fibers that can be used
    for hardness sensors and other applications. There is a substantial benefit of
    using the cation-exchange material of the hardness sensor. The sensor detects
    the electrical resistance of the entire mass of the cation exchange material between
    the electrodes. Earlier experiments indicate that cation-exchange fibers offer
    superior performance compared to membranes, but no commercially available fibers
    exist. After reliable fibers have been produced, they will be installed in hardness
    sensors to be evaluated using small column testing equipment at The University
    of Texas at El Paso, as well as in water softeners outside of the university to
    validate the salt and water savings potential. The proposed research will include
    not only sensor development, but also the measurement and control needed to automatically
    sense hardness and control regeneration in both a water softener resin bed and

    It is a critical challenge to locate an implanted device, interventional device,

    procedure. The proposed study provides a way to overcome the abovementioned challenge
    by taking advantage of an internal sound source which can be directly visualize
    via a hybrid augmented reality technology. As an example of breast cancer surgery,
    a direct tumor visualization tool will greatly reduce the surgical time and improve
    the surgical outcome. This innovation will bring considerable market opportunity.
    According to the market report, the U.S. breast lesion localization market will
    reach $878 million by 2020 from USD 445.9 Million in 2015, with a compound annual
    growth rate of 14.5%. With the value we potentially provide, our total addressable
    market is estimated to ~$200 million in 2020, which is a considerable and healthy
    market.  Other market including visualization of an interventional device or implanted
    device will further increase the value of the proposed innovation. \n\nThis proposed
    project is to develop an intraoperative tool to visually locate the breast tumor
    with high accuracy. In 2015, there were 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer,
    and an estimated 60,290 additional cases of noninvasive breast cancer. It is challenging
    for the surgeon to accurately localize the tumor during lumpectomy, especially
    when the tumor is non-palpable. However, the current technologies cannot provide
    quantitative location of the implanted device and real-time visual feedback of
    that location. Therefore, it creates problems on a large re-excision rate, and
    a prolonged surgical time.  The project proposes to address these unmet needs
    by developing an acoustic guide-wire with an augmented reality system that can
    provide real-time visual feedback on the location of the tumor with sub-millimeter
    variance. These functions are enabled by two of our innovations: 1) Visualization
    of the location of an acoustic source in turbid media for tumor localization using
    acoustic radar and augmented reality concept; 2) An ultra-low cost, miniaturized,
    omni-directional acoustic source. Owing to these advantages, this technology has

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to provide deep insights into the DNA of patients in one hour at one-fourth the cost. This will allow hospitals, clinics and research centers to delve faster into the genetic information of the patients and return essential insights to physicians, leading to faster decisions on therapy. Analyzing DNA data holds the promise of detecting several diseases and can also help in pinpointing their genetic origins, which will be key for treatment of vulnerable cases such as newborn babies, people with rare diseases, and pregnant women. By providing the analysis of whole DNA data in one hour as compared to several days, DNA tests can become mainstream, thereby reducing anxiety among patients and their relatives. As the number of patients for which deep DNA analysis will be required is doubling every year, this project aims to meet the exploding demands of large scale computational genomics of the future and enable deep DNA analysis for all patients.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to use the power of state of the art cloud computing platforms to provide analysis for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data in one hour. Several key researchers have shown that data from WGS is a critical requirement for accurate insights and detailed analysis of underlying diseases for various diseases including leukemia, breast Cancer, ADHD, Alzheimer's, congenital heart disease, HIV susceptibility, as well as others as information in the non-coding region is required. However, the computational analysis for WGS data takes several days and will be the major bottleneck for utilizing key WGS data to personalize the treatment for the affected patient. This project aims to use several high performance computing techniques on the cloud that will be tailored for NGS analyses and can accelerate the process by more than 40 times. This project uses a disruptive technology that breaks algorithms to work independently on nodes on the cloud and the team has created a collection of software optimizations to improve the utilization of cloud resources. This toolbox of optimizations is being applied to commonly used software tools in computational genomics for faster analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop and provide novel computation capabilities to the marketplace that mimic and apply the way our brain computes beyond deep learning systems and much closer to how the brain actually operates. Although
    the technology is initially targeted for the commercial drone market, the technology can be applied to consumer and hobbyist drone market, self-driving cars and advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous navigation and guiding systems with obstacle avoidance for
    robots, ballistics tracking and counter-drone capabilities for military and defense, and surveillance and counter-drone for public safety and security. This project has the potential to revolutionize robotic and machine vision by providing capabilities that simply do not exist today.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates novel ways, algorithms and software implementations that leverage expertise in natural vision systems, deep learning and machine learning to make use of electro-optical sensors, which
    respond in new ways to form the basis of an Airborne Based Sense and Avoid (ABSAA) system. It leverages the benefits of bio-inspired computation, and investigates how to combine information from multiple sensors in a common representation. The project will study novel ways to achieve robust detection, segmentation, clustering, discrimination and classification with these novel sensors. It will also extend methods and algorithms for state estimation, tracking and prediction in the inherent sensor representation. The project will also address the real-time constraints and will attempt to leverage recent hardware implementations, which can provide a complete embedded system for ABSAA system that is low SWaP (size, weight and power) and in the long run, low cost as well because it has the potential to benefit from economy of scale. The theoretical and algorithmic advances generated by the project have the potential to affect
    machine and robotic vision well beyond the project focused application to ABSAA.

- abstractText: "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project is to improve access to high-quality, responsive, and evidence-based
    treatments for risky users of alcohol and other drugs. Current standards of care
    are cost-prohibitive, time-intensive and overly reliant on community support groups
    lacking a scientific basis or a mechanism for accountability. The research proposed
    here will add to an interactive online platform providing tools and treatment
    for individuals seeking to change their relationship to substances. The technological
    innovation supported by this research will result in a graphical meter that provides
    users of the platform with a simple-to-interpret interface. This tool is designed
    to strengthen motivation, enhance capacity for self-assessment, and allow for
    the better allocation of care provision resources. This development will give
    the proposing organization a major competitive advantage as it contributes to
    the growing field of digitally-provided behavioral healthcare products. Employers,
    insurers, and consumers have communicated a clear demand for new methods of treating
    individuals with substance use disorders, and this technology will equip the proposing
    organization to meet that demand. \n\nThe proposed project addresses the \"black
    box\" of recovery from risky use of alcohol and other drugs. Ample research demonstrates
    that behavioral interventions can be effective ways to mitigate risk for individuals
    with unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs. Monitoring, assessing, and quantifying
    that recovery, however, remains out of reach for behavioral interventions delivered
    in the current standard-of-care. Instead of present-moment substance use recovery,
    the typical measure remains previous substance consumption. By statistically analyzing
    a range of available data from users of an online substance use recovery platform,
    this research will identify the data most correlated with successful recovery
    from substance use. Regression modeling and bivariate correlations will explore
    the relationships between different data within the platform and several validated
    outcome measures already integrated into the intervention. This research will
    use discourse analysis and natural language processing to identify and categorize
    user-submitted content to identify linguistic elements related to substance use
    recovery or risk of relapse. The principal outcome will be a holistic measure
    of recovery from substance use aggregating multiple instruments and domains of
    substance health. It will be developed into a graphical interface that communicates
    to both users and other behavioral healthcare stakeholders in-the-moment recovery
    from risky substance use."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to develop a tool to allow for more rapid screening
    of engineered yeast strains for the production of desirable biochemical compounds.
    Industries such as specialty chemicals, food, energy, personal care, and pharmaceuticals
    are increasingly using engineered microorganisms, especially yeast, for biochemical
    production. A key challenge in strain engineering is screening.  In order to find
    the optimal genetic changes that direct a strain to produce the target molecule
    efficiently, companies have to build and screen large numbers of strains. Current
    best practices using automation allow companies to screen strains at a cost of
    approximately $1-5 per strain with a throughput of hundreds to a thousand strains
    per day. The proposed yeast sensors enable ultra high-throughput screening of
    yeast strains, allowing the measurement of tens of millions of strains per day
    at a cost below $0.00002 per strain. This technology will not only substantially
    improve the economics and success rate of strain engineering projects, but it
    will allow the exploration of much more complex design spaces and enable otherwise
    intractable projects. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to create a platform

    to then rapidly construct and test vast numbers of these predicted sensors, identifying
    those with the requisite sensing and response characteristics in yeast. The resulting
    sensors will allow the rapid engineering of yeast strains by altering yeast cell

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in helping people cultivate healthy lifestyles. Over the last few decades, an epidemic of lifestyle diseases has developed in the United States. Unhealthy lifestyles, such as inactivity, poor nutrition and sedentary behaviors are driving up the prevalence of chronic disease such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease. As of 2012, about 117 million people had one or more chronic health conditions. Although chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes are among the most common and costly of all diseases, simply adopting healthy lifestyles can prevent many of these chronic diseases. About 86% of all health care spending in 2010 was for chronic medical conditions. Preventive approaches can offset current healthcare costs. However, prevention is typically implemented as labor-intensive coaching or mobile health apps that lack sufficient personalization to be effective. The technology platform being developed in this project will combine the best of both mobile and in-person coaching for a fraction of the cost of in-person coaching.

    The proposed project will help people to cultivate lifestyle changes. For a lifestyle disease patient, it is very difficult to change lifelong habits to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Hence, compliance with the recommendations of a doctor or coach is a long standing problem. Several reminder and tracker apps attempt to help with compliance and adoption of healthy lifestyle. Unlike such solutions, our approach is unique in its ability to proactively intervene with highly targeted interventions at the right moment, which is when compliance is most likely. Such moments will be captured through the ability of the platform to incorporate context-sensitivity. The platform will understand the context of each patient and will enable the coach to deliver interventional messages at the right moment, thereby increasing the likelihood of compliance and assisting with formation of healthy habits. The platform also provides scalability without significant loss in personalization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to optimize and reduce agro-chemical and irrigation applications for the United States agricultural industry, reducing environmental contamination, and increasing overall crop health and production with a smart phone compatible miniaturized optical sensor. The diagnostic sensor, designed for use in the precision agriculture market sector, captures optical spectrographs of a plant that can be used to diagnose the overall health of the plant, and provide recommendations for optimizing care. In discerning whether a plant suffers from a nutrient deficiency, a water stress, or a disease pressure, the sensor provides a means for substantial commercial impact. By providing this market sector with the needed quantitative information to both specialize and optimize crop treatment plans, substantial agro-chemical and irrigation resources are saved. From a societal perspective, these commercial savings directly translate into reduced agro-chemical applications of crops, which help reduce eutrophication of environmental water bodies, protecting drinking water supplies. By optimizing irrigation usage, the sensor reduces irrigation demands, helping ensure the longevity of these sources of irrigation. By enabling big data analysis of optical spectrographs that correlate with underlying crop health conditions, the project provides insight into physiological factors governing crop health, advancing scientific understanding.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is directed towards miniaturizing high precision optical spectrophotometers, traditionally confined to laboratory usage, for use in precision agriculture. The agricultural industry struggles to identify or anticipate changes in crop health and take appropriate measures of response. As multiple environmental stressors or factors can cause similar visual symptoms in a crop, optimal decision-making becomes decidedly difficult, and can lead to costly commercial and societal impacts. In response to this problem, this project aims to first develop a handheld smart phone-based spectrophotometer for real time diagnosis of crop health. Afterwards, the capabilities of the device will be extensively tested in controlled greenhouse studies of crops under varying nutrient and hydration conditions. Finally, the data collected in these studies will be analyzed and benchmarked against gold standard techniques of assessment. From these studies, the performance of the optical sensor will be clearly assessed. Specifically, the degree to which the sensor can discern amongst varying environmental stressors affecting a crop, and also the degree to which the sensor can provide quantitative feedback about the severity of those stressors, will be provided.

    proposed flexible battery technology solves the major problems (e.g. mechanical
    failure, low capacity) of the existing battery designs for wearable/flexible electronics
    (e.g. smart watches, apparel, eye wear, and medical patches). Xerion Advanced
    Battery Corporation (XABC)?s battery design can potentially close the current
    technological gap between electronic devices and their supporting batteries and
    further accelerate the wearable/flexible electronics sector, which is expected
    to grow at 53.7% compounded annual growth rate. The development of this battery
    technology will provide important scientific insights and practical guidance towards
    various fundamental principles of battery designs such as stress handling, form
    factor adaptability, assembly, integration, and energy and power optimization.
    Furthermore, XABC?s novel battery fabrication technique, which utilizes a high
    throughput electroplating process to produce battery grade materials and electrodes,
    has the potential to drive innovations in other energy storage initiatives (e.g.
    high-energy, low-cost batteries for automotive) in both academia and industry.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes an
    innovative flexible battery design to meet the growing demand for wearable/flexible
    electronics.  The proposed flexible batteries are made of electrodes realized
    via directly electroplating high-quality, high-energy battery materials on current
    collectors. In most existing flexible batteries, battery materials are bonded
    by polymer binders, resulting in loose contacts during bending and thus loss of
    battery materials. In contrast, the electroplated materials are chemically bonded
    to the current collector, which significantly enhances the electrode integrity
    during repeated bending and deformation. Such strong bonding also enables fast
    electron transport in the electrode and thus boosts the battery power. Here, XABC
    will develop high-performance flexible batteries via its patented electroplating
    technique. Research will focus on investigating various aspects of the flexible
    battery design including electroplating optimization, current collector selection,
    battery assembly, and packaging. XABC will demonstrate capability of making fully
    packaged flexible battery prototypes with various form factors for flexible electronics
    and perform detailed electrochemical and mechanical characterization. The proposed
    flexible battery prototype is expected to show high energy, high power, and excellent
    capacity retention after thousands of bending and deformation cycles."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, bioabsorbable surgical
    clip and applicator for rapid closure of the dura mater in open and minimally
    invasive spine surgery. The dura mater is the protective membrane that covers
    the brain and spinal cord and contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Openings in
    the dura (durotomy) can result in CSF leakage which, if not repaired, can cause
    potentially fatal complications including spinal headaches, pseudomeningocele,
    and meningitis. Currently, the dura is closed using fine suture in a difficult
    and time-consuming process requiring upwards of 30 minutes of additional operating
    room time. Durotomies occur in approximately 10% of spinal surgeries and with
    1.7M spinal surgeries, closure of incidental durotomies costs the healthcare system
    an estimated $408M each year. Utilization of a bioabsorbable clip and applicator
    system for dural closure will significantly increase the rate of repair, simplify
    the work of clinicians, and reduce surgery time and overall costs to the healthcare
    system. Use of this technology could be expanded to closure of cranial dura, as
    well as other surgical specialties such as urology, OB/GYN, and general surgery.
    \n\nThe proposed project aims to develop a bioabsorbable, non-penetrating clip
    for rapid closure of the dura mater in spine surgery. The goal is to produce clips
    capable of closing dura and holding a water tight seal as compared to the current

    of a biocompatible, bioabsorbable polymer that will safely degrade in the body
    after the dura has healed. The clips will also be radiolucent (invisible to x-ray
    and computed tomography imaging) to allow for unobstructed imaging of the surgical
    site. In addition, the clips will be non-penetrating to avoid lacerating the dura,
    reducing the risk of CSF leakage and possible fatal medical complications. This
    project also aims to develop an inexpensive, disposable applicator system that
    will apply the clips for dural closure. The applicator will be designed for use
    in both open and minimally invasive surgery and will house a reservoir of clips
    for complete dural closure without removal of the applicator from the surgical
    site for reloading."

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses a critical need in medicine ? the ability to deliver drugs selectively to parts of the body that need medication.  Targeted drug delivery improves patient outcomes by treating tissues locally while reducing overall exposure and side effects elsewhere. For example, a cream or lotion type product which moves anti-inflammatory drugs through skin specifically to an affected joint is better than taking a pill which medicates the entire body. Nanoparticles, especially liposomes (nanometer size water balloons consisting of a fatty wall surrounding an aqueous interior) are useful for targeted drug delivery because of their ability to move through biological barriers including skin. Unfortunately, use of liposomes is limited because the drug carrying capacity is too small, especially for water insoluble drugs.  Lipoleosomes are a new type of liposome with a much greater carrying capacity for drugs.  The objective of this project is to make lipoleosomes with ibuprofen, a water-insoluble drug and demonstrate the ability to move ibuprofen through skin for localized treatment of joints and muscles. This will be valuable for developing a lotion product to treat arthritis and injuries while avoiding stomach problems.

    The creation of lipoleosomes resulted from a remarkable discovery ? that under certain conditions, flat fatty layers (lipid bilayers) existing in microemulsions can be reshaped by hydration into spherical liposome form. Because microemulsion lipid bilayers can contain large amounts of water-insoluble (hydrophobic) compounds (easily up to 65%), so can the product liposomes. Previously, hydrophobic drug content of liposomes rarely exceeded 5%. In light of the extraordinarily greater drug capacity, the new liposomes were named lipoleosomes, indicating a liposome into which organic compounds (oleo) have been inserted.  It is a scientific curiosity that some microemulsion lipid layers reshape to give membrane structures because in the past, hydration had only been known to give filled emulsion droplets which do not have the important biological features of liposomes. In this project, the quality and yield of lipoleosomes and their biological characteristics will be improved by understanding the influence of precursor microemulsion properties and processing conditions. This will result in the availability of new, biologically effective lipoleosomal ibuprofen compositions and methods of synthesis, plus physical and biometric data that supports submission of a new drug application for a topical ibuprofen lotion or cream. Establishing lipoleosomes as a new type of nanoparticle has implications for many other drugs and for routes of administration other than dermal.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project would be to make it safer to send premature babies home after their stay in the NICU. They will be more likely to grow and thrive while they regain valuable bonding time with their parents. The risk of having to readmit babies would go down. Complications and maybe even SIDS could be reduced, because we would have a better way to measure and understand the development of these babies after they leave the hospital but continue to mature for the first year. Our physicians are excellent, but their decisions can only be as reliable as the information they are provided. Many cases doctors are forced to make difficult decisions between keeping a baby longer at greater cost and further separation or sending the baby home to begin a new life, but at the risk that the baby's central nervous system may not be quite up to the job of keeping the basic heart, lung and temperature at the right levels. This project will give physicians better more accurate information to reduce the guesswork and keep the babies safe.

    The proposed project will result in a miniature throw away sensor strip that nurses stick on the outer eyelid of a premature baby. The technology, called OMT allows us to read the innermost control signals of the deepest and most important part of the brain called the brainstem. Neuroscientists now know that one of the most important jobs that the brainstem does is to help control the most basic primitive life functions such as changing the rate of breathing, body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate.  Develop a thin film sensor and instrument that is capable of successfully recording brainstem biosignals in premature babies, both technically and physiologically, and; demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish between pre-terms with and without discharge problems The project plan is to complete the design and assembly of the instrument and to sample the data from a late pre-term infant to determine basic viability of signal and satisfactory detection. Following that the team will produce a small lot of sensors and several test units to measure 9-18 young patients in three cohorts. This basic validation of the instrument and clinical value is the key next step to successful commercialization of the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate novel
    approaches for biopolymer materials that uniquely enable oxygen incorporation into hydrogel
    dressings to improve and accelerate chronic wound healing. The proposed work differs drastically
    from other research programs and commercial efforts to use oxygen in chronic wound healing as
    it is the first to combine oxygen, a moist and clean healing environment, and antimicrobial
    properties into one cost-effective and easy-to-use product. Current commercial oxygen-delivery
    therapies for wound care, e.g., hyperbaric oxygen chambers and topical oxygen devices, are
    intermittent, inconvenient to use, and require access to expensive specialized equipment.
    Successfully introducing oxygenating wound dressings to the market will allow addressing the
    serious and pervasive burden on healthcare facilities and the exorbitant costs associated with
    chronic wound care. In the USA alone, diabetic chronic wounds cause direct healthcare-related
    costs of $1.5 billion and total direct and indirect costs of $20 billion.
    The proposed research incorporates proprietary patent-pending biopolymer materials and
    processing methods to create oxygenating hydrogels that can be made into wound dressings.
    The dressings have the unique potential to provide uniform and tunable oxygenation to heal
    chronic wounds. Dressing embodiments, syntheses, and manufacturing techniques will be
    explored to improve product performance and characteristics, reduce costs, and demonstrate
    commercial feasibility and viability of the production process. Thus, knowledge of biomaterials for
    wound care will be significantly advanced by the proposed research. Prototype wound dressings
    will be characterized and tested based on customer requirements.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will apply the novel nanotechnology
    to the problem of pneumonia and sepsis.  Pneumonia is the second worldwide cause of death and first among children under 5 years old, and is the number one cause of sepsis. The mainstay
    of treatment is empiric antibiotic selection, which increases multidrug resistant organisms
    and may not appropriately address the cause of the infection, thus potentially increasing
    mortality. The broader impact of diagnosing the cause of pneumonia at the bedside or in the field within 10 minutes with no need for a central laboratory will produce a new paradigm and decrease patient mortality, cost, and multi-drug resistant organisms. The technology will move the field to a new era of screening high risk patients for pneumonia, before severe infection or sepsis occurs. The technology will also serve as the missing tool to greater understand the natural history and epidemiology of pneumonia, as the causative organism in pneumonia is only found in half of patients at present. The annual cost for pneumonia and sepsis in United States hospitals is $30 billion.

    The technology uses nanotechnology to greatly increase the surface area for nanoscale binding events that are measured with changes of impedance which are then correlated to a concentration of the target biomarker.  The technology will move the pneumonia field from the current qualitative result to a quantitative reading. The detection of common causes of pneumonia will be accomplished from a drop of blood, urine, and/or saliva. Synthetic solutions with pneumonia biomarkers will be constructed.  Analytical parameters including accuracy, precision, linearity, calibration, limit of blank, limit of detection, functional sensitivity, and interfering substances will be evaluated.  In addition, the optimum manufacturing process for a disposable sensor cartridge will be determined. This will include an assessment of dry versus wet biochemistry, appropriate manufacturing method, accuracy, calibration, storage, temperature, ageing, and final design concepts. The goal of the proposed research is to produce an alpha prototype of the sensor cartridge that can detect the pneumonia biomarkers from synthetic solutions of blood, urine, and saliva.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project focused on an automated painting and overspray capture system is a significant increase in the health/safety of construction workers and profitability/production efficiency of the construction industry. Painting workers suffer from increased short and long term health problems due to exposure to paint fumes, including increased potential for certain cancers and cognitive damage. Construction projects are delayed due to injuries, lack of available skilled labor, and prohibitive costs. A system that can eliminate major health and safety risks by capturing harmful fumes as well as increase productivity by autonomously working alongside skilled workers will have a significant positive impact on the construction industry and workers. This innovation could open the construction industry up to myriads of intelligent, autonomous solutions that improve health, safety, quality, and production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will work to establishing the technical and commercial feasibility of an automated system to paint and capture overspray. The SBIR project will focus on the device responsible for directing paint from the spraying apparatus to the surface to be painted and containment of overspray and harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The health hazards of paint fumes and airborne VOCs are apparent through the increased risk of certain cancers and long-term cognitive damage suffered by painters. Additionally, painting at heights on ladders or other lift equipment presents a safety and efficiency problem. The research objectives of this SBIR are to develop a system that can effectively contain overspray/paint fumes while being small/lightweight enough for use by a robotic platform. Extensive flow analysis will be conducted with experimental geometry and flow visualization techniques on benchtop test rigs to evaluate geometry and flow characteristics. Successful benchtop test designs will be further tested on a robotic platform to evaluate system-level performance for paint quality, over spray containment, and airborne VOCs.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a web-based application that assists prospective and new college students in the challenging decision of the major/minor choice for their college degree. Studies have shown that 20 to 50 percent of students enter college as undecided in terms of intended majors, and subsequently an astonishing 75 percent actually change their major at least once before graduation. These statistics illustrate one of the key factors that hinder on-time degree completion and boost total student debt to the trillion dollar level. The proposed system administers a brief but highly-regarded personality quiz, then displays majors and minors that align with the results of that quiz. The student makes selections from this list, then clicks a button to see groups of corresponding semester-by-semester shortest-path degree plans with labels indicating their alignment with the personality quiz result. This easy-to-use approach empowers students to make early, well-informed college career choices. Colleges across the country will want to purchase and install this software for many reasons, including: to show their commitment to helping students avoid the all-too-common difficulties and expense of poor college career decisions, to obtain improved graduation rates, and to improve administrative resource planning for future semesters via a database of their students' plans.

    The key technical innovations of this software system include integration of a personality interest assessment profile within a degree planning system, assignment of interest vectors to individual college courses along with the utilization of this information in the development of degree plans that are well-aligned with student interest vectors, the use of state-of-the-art mathematical optimization techniques in order to quickly generate shortest-path degree plans, and automated multiple-plan generation followed by clustering and cluster labeling within this plan collection in order to provide a simple interface that allows a student to easily navigate through a collection of alternative degree plans. These technical innovations are made possible by the many years of experience in algorithm development by the company team members, and represent an approach not seen in the very limited collection of existing academic planning software, which tends to focus on cumbersome drag-and-drop technology that discourages the exploration of alternative degree paths. The goal of this research is to provide an easy-to-customize and easy-to-install degree planning system that will be readily affordable by any academic institution and that will allow prospective and undecided students to discover and explore in detail - with just a few mouse clicks - those college careers that are aligned with their personal interests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be seen in the adoption of solar energy as a cost-competitive alternative to non-renewable energy sources. While solar energy costs have been dramatically reduced, the use of the most efficient cells is limited by manufacturing costs. The need for efficient cells - solar cells that deliver more watts per area - can be seen when considering system costs. Higher efficiency reduces all costs related to area: module components, support structures, labor, land, etc. Silicon Heterojunctions (SHJ) cells deliver leading conversion efficiencies but are manufactured with processes that require multiple passes through very expensive machines to deposit required semiconductor layers. The manufacturing cost issue has hindered adoption of the high efficiency SHJ cell technology. The project's innovation dramatically reduces the cost of the most expensive steps in SHJ cell manufacture while maintaining or improving cell performance. Potentially, the innovation could find application in other markets such as organic light emitting diodes (LEDs). The cost reduction of the SHJ cell will significantly shift the photovoltaic industry's energy conversion efficiency upward and the cost per watt downward.

    The proposed project addresses two shortcomings of the established manufacturing methods for SHJ solar cells. The first challenge is the deposition of the cell's transparent conductive layer, typically an alloy called indium tin oxide (ITO). Standard sputter processes used for this deposition cause damage to the underlying layers of the cell. The damage can reduce the cell performance or require additional process steps. Also, next generation concepts for SHJ cell design are even more sensitive to damage and less able to tolerate "repair" steps. The project will develop a novel low damage sputter source for the ITO deposition. The second challenge is that the semiconductor layers of the SHJ cell use costly plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) systems developed for the high value display industry. The project will direct use of the novel sputter source for deposition of the semiconductor layers as well as the ITO. Sputter is lower cost than PECVD and easily allows sequential layers of different materials to be deposited in a single, continuous flow, in-line machine. The project will demonstrate the sputter source for each of the layers as separate materials and for an SHJ cell with a fully sputtered stack of the three critical layers.

    Research (SBIR) project is to harness the power of engineered gut microbes for

    that respond to gastrointestinal conditions to deliver new therapeutic activities
    to specific sites in the gut at the appropriate dose and time. This SBIR project
    will improve the reliability of these cell-based therapies by allowing for precise

    IBD is a chronic disease with no cure and low response rates to current treatments,
    affecting 1.4 million Americans at an annual cost of $6.3 billion in the US alone.
    In addition to solving a critical remaining challenge in bringing this IBD therapy

    This SBIR Phase I project will benefit society by reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic pharmaceuticals and improving their quality, including pharmaceuticals that are currently too costly to manufacture because they target relatively small patient populations. The proposed innovation will advance state-of-the-art by providing a continuous in-situ multi-analyte sensor enabling novel methods of drug quality assurance. This multi-analyte sensor will allow biopharmaceutical companies, for the first time, to monitor the concentration of the product in-situ as it is being produced along with the concentrations of other important culture analytes. The sensor array will have the unique ability to measure time dependent correlations between pH, osmolality, and concentrations of glucose, lactate and monoclonal antibodies. This ability unlocks new avenues for optimizing upstream biopharmaceutical production which consumes about 35% of biologic drug cost of goods. Efficient control of upstream processes using sensors such as the one proposed is expected to reduce these costs up to 30%. Furthermore, this technology can be directed towards other analytes by replacing the sensing molecules. Thus, the proposed technology can be used as a sensing platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing or in medical diagnostics, food processing, and water quality.

    This project will demonstrate the feasibility of adapting newly discovered affinity ligands for bioprocess sensing; thereby obtaining the first in-situ biosensor that can be used to monitor the concentration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) during manufacturing in real time. This biosensor will be based on a novel magnetically transduced stimuli-responsive hydrogel containing affinity ligands that target mAbs. This antibody sensor will be integrated into an existing in-situ bioreactor sensor array capable of monitoring other key parameters: pH, osmolality, glucose, and lactate. Thus, the proposed sensor array will be a powerful tool to advance process analytics and biomanufacturing. Product feasibility will be demonstrated via three objectives: 1) Synthesize a novel magnetically transduced stimuli-responsive hydrogel containing affinity ligands that specifically bind to mAbs. 2) Incorporate the hydrogel of objective 1 into a sensor suitable for monitoring the concentration of mAbs in cell culture media in the concentration range relevant to biomanufacturing. 3) Integrate the antibody sensor into an existing sensor array and demonstrate its performance under typical antibody manufacturing conditions. This adaptable technology can be leveraged towards a number of protein targets; thus the proposed project represents a transformative approach that will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing across a multitude of applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will not only produce a multifunctional thermal insulation structure that is easy to install onto any existing single-, double-, or even triple-pane windows in reducing total building energy consumption, but also improve water condensation issues and occupant discomfort that are associated with single-pane windows in cool climates. Furthermore, the smart window system includes a soundproof layer that can attenuate noise, outperforming a triple-pane window without deterioration of optical properties. In cold climates, the film, which uses a low-e coating, will prove the exterior temperature condition (< -5 °C) required for interior condensation to occur in winter. The proposed approach outperforms existing doubleor triple-pane windows with Al frames and conventional spacers and will enjoy a share of the already-popular energy saving windows market (61.6%, or ~$10 billion Global). According to our cost estimate for a 1 square foot smart window of the design dimension proposed (including all chemical and energy costs in a scalable roll-to-roll process), a $5/ft2 manufacturing cost can be achieved, providing a great incentive with a pay-off period within 5 years for customers.

    The proposed project will address thermal, optical, and acoustic concerns on an existing singlepane window simultaneously. The thin window film realizes a low U-factor (&#8804; 0.45) within 3mm in thickness, through the combination of a super-low thermal conductive supporting material, and two distinct coatings (low transmittance in infrared region) on a thin film, which can be readily attached to a single-pane glass window. It also yields noise attenuation &#8805; 50 dB with designed cavities embedded in the window film to attenuate noise transmission. The resulting sheet can not only enhance acoustic insulation performance but also reduce the volume of the porous membrane used and thus cost. In addition, the smart film demonstrates all-season operation of smart-glass based on temperature-responsive, tunable Near-IR transmittance in a tunable thermochromic coating without electric power consumption. The film controls haze by Page 11 controlling light scattering in the interface of granulate materials and reduces the volume fraction of the structural material used in the proposed smart film. The combined low-e and thermochromic coatings will help the film achieve a high color rendering index because visible transmittances for the coatings are excellent complements to each other, thus exhibiting a broad and uniform transmission over the visible spectrum.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable flexible carrier aggregation in mobile wireless networks using frequency-translational quadrature-hybrid (FTQH) technology. The customer demand for wireless connectivity keeps increasing both in terms of more connected devices and higher data rates. Carrier aggregation is a critical technology to further increase data rates for next-generation heterogeneous wireless networks. It lets mobile network operators and neutral hosts make more effective use of their fragmented spectral resources. Mobile communications are now an essential part of our personal and professional lives and impact all aspects of our society from business, to government, to education and the non-profit sector. The small business concern will generate OEM RF front-end products for the small-cell base station market which is growing rapidly with more than 10 million small-cell base station shipments estimated in 2020. This will strengthen the US commercial technology base and generate US employment opportunities as it grows its workforce.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of the FTQH technology. This technology promises to enable the design of modular, flexible RF front ends for small-cell base stations. FTQH is a novel architectural approach that leverages existing RF filtering, RF switching and RF routing technologies while enabling low cost, high performance, modular RF front ends for flexible carrier aggregation.

    huge economic value for businesses all around the globe. The wireless connectivity has been focused
    around human-to-human communication but in the next decade machine-to-machine communication will

    economic impact is projected to be anywhere between $7-15 trillion globally in the next decade and the
    impact of it will be felt by virtually every industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the two key problems with the
    current state-of-the-art wireless sensor nodes. First is the limited battery-life and second is the cost of the
    sensor nodes. Low power standard compliant wireless communication plays a key role in extending the
    battery-life of a wireless sensor node. Experience with semiconductors dictates that complete system
    integration on a single piece of silicon (zero external components) not only reduces the cost of the system
    (in high volume) but also improves the systems? overall energy efficiency. This enables operation on
    harvested energy requiring no external battery. No external components imply that the microsystem needs
    to operate from energy sources with limited capacity. No external components also imply no quartz crystal
    frequency reference, which almost every microsystem uses as of today for frequency and timing reference.
    Off-chip crystal is a bulky component that poses a severe size limitation for low-profile millimeter scale
    microsystems. Eliminating off-chip crystal is a significant step forward towards energy autonomous
    millimetre-scale microsystems that have widespread commercial applications.

    This SBIR Phase I project intends to create a human to machine language tool that allows anything from the simplest shape to the most complex engineering design to be fabricated anywhere that a robotic fabrication machine and the necessary raw materials exist. At a high level many parts are created today customized to a specific users need and a small handful of humans have the knowhow and access to machines to create such customized parts on their own. The complexity of this can be mitigated by creating tools for translation of information from people?s ideas to machine output with much less error and cost. By creating a means to simplify the process of getting from idea to customized fabricated parts, the proposed tool can help achieve balance between creativity and production more easily for Maker Manufacturing. Upon successfully deploying a uniformed solution to the overly complex mesh of fabrication processes used today, hundreds of thousands of new machines can be employed at any end point by interchangeable people to bring to bear goods at any level of precision needed. The end goal is creation of a portal and toolset for fabricators to take and fulfill small batch manufacturing of parts. Success will mean that hundreds to thousands of times more people will be able to create tangible goods from ideas and concept combinations.


    This is a project to unify CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Machining) across all digital fabrication tools and reduce the complexity of machining designs. While 3D printing may bring an idea of simplicity and access to everyone, laser cutting, CNC (Computer Numeric Controlled or Robotic), injection molding, vacuum forming, and other tools of mass production can likewise also be made more accessible. The project is a software tool embodying a single process for which any design can start at one end and any machine be placed at the other end. At least in showing how much of the same end result, if any, each machine is capable of producing of the intended output. This project will produce a part plus material algorithm by which any part that can be fabricated can be proposed to the algorithm and all of the machines capable of producing them can be identified. From there the scale - both in size of part and number - of copies of the part can be added in and thus sort the machines by best part quality, price, and overall speed of production at any volume. The goal of the research is to capture all existing manufacturing practices in machine shops and Maker places, and assure that none of today?s capabilities are lost while creating a living algorithm that allows for future capabilities to be added to any fabrication process.

    now occur.  The research has the intended result of integrating micro-sensor tools
    into a small condenser cleaning ball with the initial objectives of sensing in-tube
    temperature and velocity data, determining the exact tube location of the sensor
    ball, developing continuous heat-transfer characteristics to better predict efficiency
    effects, and?importantly?to develop a platform for future integration of sensors
    that add new sensing capabilities.  As envisioned, this work will result in the
    development/operation of the first ever sub-1-inch-dia submersible sensor ball
    that can autonomously measure velocity and temperature inside shell-and-tube heat-exchangers
    along with precise tube location determination of the ball inside the system for
    accurate, location-specific measurements."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a substantial
    increase in the efficiency and reliability of the power grid, which would result
    in lower electricity rates to consumers and facilitate the integration of renewable
    energy into the grid. This project will enable the use of topology optimization
    in the operation of the power transmission grid and allow operators to adapt the
    grid configuration to address changes in system conditions in real time. These
    adaptive reconfigurations increase the ability of the system to transfer power
    across the network in the directions that matter for economic, reliability, or
    environmental reasons. The economic benefits of topology optimization represent
    a 50% reduction in the cost of grid congestion, which translates to $1-4 billion/year
    production cost savings in the US. In addition, topology optimization would consistently
    reduce, or entirely remove, the otherwise frequent overloads on transmission facilities,
    thereby increasing the reliability of the grid. Topology optimization would also
    facilitate grid operations with large amounts of variable renewable resources,
    such as wind and solar, by relieving their curtailment by about 40%. Given the
    increase in renewable energy in the generation mix, topology optimization is expected
    to become even more effective and important in the future. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop fast and adaptive power
    system model reduction software fully integrated with topology optimization software.
    The technical challenge arises from the fact that finding a power flow solution
    for a large full nodal model of a power system requires the model to be reduced
    to an equivalent smaller model, to avoid numerical issues with the full model.
    For typical analyses, this reduction only needs to be performed once; however,
    for topology optimization, in the course of finding a good topology configuration,
    hundreds of different topologies need to be analyzed. Thus, the main technical
    hurdle preventing topology optimization from being used in online operations decision-support
    is the current state-of-the-art model reduction computation speed. As such, this
    project?s objective is to lower the computation time of the model reduction component
    by at least 10 times compared to existing capabilities in commercial software,
    when used as part of topology optimization routines. Model reduction calculations
    will be designed to take advantage of problem-specific attributes of the topology
    optimization routine, which will enable reduced computation time, by, for example,
    making use of partial recalculations and decomposition of the problem to support
    parallelization."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address the ability to use automation to harvest strawberries in the United States in an environment where migrant labor is scarce and the work is undesirable. The project is borrowing techniques and methods that have been used and refined in many other high volume manufacturing/production industries and applying the applicable ideas to harvesting food crops with automated machines. Big data methods are also being developed in conjunction with the acquisition techniques that will assist crop growing with predictive information about future yields and help with monitoring plant health in relation to disease and pest infestation. The business model being developed helps the adoption of the technology into the farming community by not requiring the farmers to have large capital outlays by providing the anticipated machines to the farmers as a service to replace their labor. The initiation of the service will therefore be an easy decision for a farmer to make and will be helpful in establishing the standard for future harvesting models and techniques.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is developing techniques and ideas to be able to accomplish the robotic harvesting of some of the most labor intensive and delicate fruit. Special machine vision techniques are being utilized to be able to simultaneously detect, decipher and target the fruit at a speeds conducive to commercial harvesting. Also, unique machine techniques that will enable the harvesting of the fruit without bruising. Objectives include experimenting with ideas that will lead to more consistent fruit packing and techniques to increase fruit shelf life after picking. Most prior research in these areas focused on being able to pick the fruit with machines and not so much on the ability to do it at commercial speeds. The entire purpose of the systems of the Harvest CROO is to rapidly acquire the fruit under the plants and then be able to pack and carry it out of the fields. Many of the projects until this point had no allotment for removing the fruit from the fields. The Harvest CROO system will establish standards for this.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the reduction
    in the cost of renewable energy. The dramatic decline in the cost of wind energy
    over the last several decades has been fueled by the ever increasing turbine size
    and the introduction of new manufacturing methods and materials. However, the
    industry is approaching the limits of this trend due to the increased wear and
    tear of the turbine blades and drive train, caused by unsteady aerodynamic forces.
    Turbine manufacturers have been studying and testing various approaches to mitigate
    unsteady aerodynamic loads, including independent blade pitch control, trailing
    edge flaps, microtabs, boundary layer blowing, and mechanical camber control.
    Each of these potential solutions is costly, complex, and requires moving parts.
    As a result, none has moved beyond the prototype stage. The new active load-control
    system, based on plasma actuators, has the potential to leap-frog all other solutions.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
    the feasibility of countering unsteady aerodynamic forces in utility-scale wind
    turbines by controlling the air flow around the blades with blade-mounted plasma
    actuators. This fully electronic flow control device will mitigate aerodynamic
    loads and enable the deployment of larger, more efficient and more durable turbines.
    Leveraging recent improvement in plasma actuator technology, with a ten-fold increase
    in thrust, and with one-tenth of the power consumption, a new innovative actuator
    will be designed, built and tested with 2-4X performance improvement over the
    current state of the art. This level of performance will be sufficient to counter
    unsteady aerodynamic forces in large wind turbines with blade tip speeds of up
    to 200 miles/hour."

    This Phase I project will determine the efficacy of cutting-edge digital technologies for language acquisition by non-native English speakers.  In particular, the hypothesis that Spanish-speaking students learn more effectively when given native-language educational tools will be tested.  As they progress through the study, students will transition from Spanish-only to bilingual or English-only instruction appropriate to their level of attainment, using award-winning digital platforms and learning tools.  Research suggests that technologies that leverage native language ability to calibrate achievement are more effective than English-only instruction.  However, current methods are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. As a consequence, more than 40% of today's non-native speakers drop out of school.  Students who learn English fluently have been shown to excel in all academic areas and, therefore, become fuller participants in American civil society.  If successful, this project will enhance an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use in schools nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation's mission.

    Existing products in educational software offer limited comprehensible input - basic instruction in non-English languages - and typically do not employ best practices for the transference of Spanish language ability to English learning programs.  This project proposes to employ an existing language-acquisition platform, combined with a set of Spanish-language and bilingual language scaffolding tools, to determine the most effective practices for English learning.  Researchers will conduct a six-month pilot project in one or several Southern California public school districts, and success will be measured by the Bateria en Español and Woodcock Language Proficiency Tests. The project will leverage this platform to determine the optimal combination of language tools (sentence frames) and the best timeframe for transitioning instruction from Spanish to English (from Level 1 to Level 2 instruction).  The project will employ best-practice techniques according to the Shelter Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) and the Bilingual Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition (BCIRC) standards.  Results will be both qualitative and quantitative, and study results will be assessed using standard measures of statistical significance.  The research team will be headed by a long-time educator and an educational software developer, and both leads are well qualified to conduct research of this type.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to increase access to and compliance with cardiac rehabilitation program and reduce the cost of avoidable hospital readmission, both by predicting which cardiac patients are at risk and by providing patients with simple but accurate guidance, allowing them to precisely control exercise intensity and volume during rehabilitation. It also has the potential to reduce the mortality rates of cardiac patients and provide doctors with a large amount of accurate information on the relationship between exercise duration, exercise intensity, and changes in cardiac patient conditions during recovery, supporting optimal design of rehabilitation program design. The key idea enabling these outcomes is using wearable sensors to measure the mechanical power outputs of cardiac patients and using these power measurements to estimate an established high-quality predictor for cardiac patient hospital readmission and mortality rates. The size of the market is substantial, with roughly one million Americans suffering from heart attacks per year.

    The proposed project will determine whether total body mechanical power output can be used to predict metabolic energy expenditure, using a ground truth based on volume of oxygen consumption per unit time. This metric, VO2 is a heavily used indicator of cardiac health for patients who have experienced heart attacks. Ambulatory mechanical power output has been used by athletes to track and provide feedback on physical condition, but it remains unclear whether similar applications are feasible for cardiac patients, due to their differing physical conditions and sensor use preferences. In addition to validating the use of mechanical power to estimate VO2 the project will also evaluate different sensor use and wearability conditions appropriate for cardiac patients, and make innovations in signal processing algorithm, sensor design, and usability required by these conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to create a user-friendly, universal control
    system for robots and sensors that for the first time would make it possible for nontechnical service
    industry professionals to task and control co-robots deployed in their facility. This simplification of
    software for an end-user will make systems of robots as easy to control as a single robot. Data collected
    over the lifecycle of the robots and sensors (which is currently not done) may aid in identification of new
    technologies to revolutionize system capabilities in the field of robotics. Although this concept could be
    applied to a wide array of service sector industries, SRT proposes to efficiently integrate and
    cooperatively control a fleet of robots and sensors to support custodial service industry tasks, because?
    though essential?custodial services add no commercial value to an organization. Thus the sector is
    clamoring for ways to reduce personnel turnover and other costs. In the U.S., custodial services are a $40
    billion industry; a mere 5% increase in efficiency would result in $2 billion in savings annually. This
    sector is rife with robots from disparate manufacturers, yet facility managers need an easy-to-use method
    to ?employ? multiple, specialized robots.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a common software
    architecture that will serve as a universal receptor for service robotics systems. The predominant technical
    hurdle is effectively combining the software protocols and coordinating control of the robots. There
    currently is no common standard for robotics software systems. The actual robot (the hardware) is
    typically the primary focus for product developers, while the software is built from a variety of
    proprietary, heritage and open sources, and is as unique as the company developing it. Little or no
    consideration is given to how robots from different manufacturers could interact in the real world. By
    standardizing the data protocols for robots and smart devices, and making that openly available, SRT
    intends to drive future open API development for hardware. Standardized APIs will still protect the
    proprietary components, but will quickly allow for data sharing across multiple devices?facilitating
    research in robotics, machine learning, and big data?by allowing end-users to quickly integrate multiple
    components into the same system, and develop their own algorithms to utilize the shared data streams.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to eliminate the need for costly trial and error in the fabrication of specialty optical fibers. Specialty fibers are rapidly finding applications in a diverse array of fields, resulting in a rapidly growing market for this technology. However, a major bottleneck in their development is the difficulty of fabricating them, since the configuration of the fiber may differ from the preform from which it is drawn. The new technology will provide value in significantly reducing costs in materials and labor associated with existing trial and error procedures by providing a tool capable of predicting in advance the preform configuration and parameters necessary to draw a desired fiber. Besides enhancing scientific understanding of the physics of fiber drawing, the development of this tool would allow more rapid exploration of the possibilities offered by specialty optical fibers.

    The proposed project would lay the mathematical groundwork necessary to develop prediction software for specialty optical fibers. By developing a mathematical model of the fluid dynamics of fiber drawing that incorporates both air channels and inclusions of viscous fluid, it would be applicable to a wide range of specialty optical fibers being developed today, including multicore fibers. The proposed project would additionally attempt to overcome previous efforts' restrictions on the slenderness of the draw-down region. Because the model will be specialized to the geometry of fiber drawing, an implementation will run fast enough for fabricators to explore a large space of possible parameters, allowing them to realize their fiber designs precisely. The model will be tested against numerical simulations of viscous threads and against experimental data. A successful outcome of the proposed project will be the development of methods that are accurate, fast enough for optimization work, and require only parameters that can be easily measured in draw towers. Implementing these methods in software will provide a crucial tool for fabricators in this rapidly expanding market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the possibility to revolutionize the treatment of cancer through more sensitive and specific cancer biomarker detection. 1.66 million Americans were diagnosed with cancer in 2014 alone, of which 585,720 died.  The sum of all health care costs in 2011 for cancer in the US was $88.7 billion.  A low cost, less invasive, and more sensitive detector will allow earlier detection of cancer and thus lower the cost of treatment and increase survival rates.  Higher sensitivity cancer detection will lead to early detection, enable targeted treatment, and save money and lives while improving quality of life.  In addition, the knowledge learned from this grant can be applied to other sensors in which the nanowires are functionalized for detection of materials.  These sensors could include sensors to support the Internet of Things, pollution monitoring, and ensuring high water quality.

    The proposed project will advance our knowledge of using nanowires as detectors. Nanowire sensors have a high surface area-to-volume ratio.  Thus their detection limit is dramatically lowered and their sensitivity is increased relative to non-nanostructured sensors.  This improvement is necessary for many biological assays. Others have made nanowire sensors and demonstrated high sensitivity.  However, the fabrication techniques they use to make their sensors are expensive and slow.  Thus, they are only able to get 1-10 nanowires per sensor and manufacturing throughput is low.  This project will use a high-throughput and low-cost process, and that results in millions of nanowires per sensor.  The nanowires will increase the surface area by over a thousand times thus allowing for more sensitive detection.   Instead of using horizontal wires like the competition, the proposed sensor uses arrays of vertically aligned nanowires.  The device design solves the typical challenges of contacting large arrays of nanowires and enables the measurement of both optical and electrical signals simultaneously.  The proposed project will measure a commercially relevant biomarker for lung cancer.  In addition, the investigators will detect two biomarkers on the same chip, thus demonstrating how the technology can be used to test multiple biomarkers on the same chip.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of a low-cost satellite network for Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices.   The proposed global communications network is orders of magnitude lower cost relative to existing options, and provides coverage at any location on the Earth.   Scientific, shipping, tracking, automotive, agriculture, energy, medical, educational, and other commercial entities will have the ability to return their data from anywhere on the planet to support tracking, safe operations, and optimal and timely decision making.  This innovative network is also expected to enable new market segments due to its unprecedented capability and cost. Further impact with the introduction of very small satellite design for swarm networking includes making space more accessible and promotes the use of smaller spacecraft resources for more complex missions. This enables the development of new products and services for data collection and return for scientific, societal, or commercial benefit.  Educational and research and development projects will also benefit with reduced barriers of entry to test new concepts and business models, making additional professional development opportunities available.

    The proposed project addresses the problem that there are no existing low-cost options for sensing, transmitting, and connecting devices from remote locations with no cell or Wifi coverage.  Existing solutions like Iridium are expensive and not utilized by the majority of markets requiring connectivity.  Swarm Technologies has developed smart, low-mass, low-power, low-cost (<1/10,000 the mass and power, and 1/400th the cost) integrated sensor and data relay platforms.  This creates the unique opportunity to develop low-cost space and ground based communication networks for global sensing, connectivity, and data return.  The long-term goal of this R&D project is to become a unique and true IoT enabler by creating an open access global space telecommunications network capable of relaying data from any space or ground IoT sensor anywhere on the planet. The research objectives of this proposal are to design and test the operational performance of the ground BEEs (the ground-relay nodes), including developing and characterizing the networking, communication, software, energy management systems.  We will utilize design, simulation techniques, and lab and environmental testing in representative environments (e.g. vacuum chamber and high altitude balloons).

    This SBIR Phase I project will provide an interactive learning environment for educational sketching which is critical in many Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. Sketching is an integral part of education from elementary school arithmetic to high school physics, and is used in professions ranging from medicine to engineering. Sketching is part of spatial visualization training, which has been shown to increase graduation rates, especially among women and other underrepresented minorities. Until now, sketching assignments have been done with pencil and paper. This project will bring sketching assignments to touchscreens on tablets and computers. The algorithm developed will provide students with real-time feedback based upon their preliminary attempts, and teachers will be able to see exactly where students are having difficulty. A unique advantage of this approach is that it tracks student persistence and rewards students who stick with a sketching assignment until completed correctly. This is an advantage over most online education that relies on multiple-choice questions, which can only be attempted once. The project will initially focus on spatial visualization training for college engineering students, but ultimately will extend throughout STEM and be adapted for K-12. The increase in retention of students in STEM will aid in meeting the national targets to support economic growth.

    The software developed will automatically grade student sketches and provide feedback similar to an expert teacher. When a student makes an error, personalized hints are generated. By providing incremental help and rewarding students when they try on their own, student persistence is encouraged. The sketching will be performed on touchscreens, and the software will be compatible with iOS, Android, Windows, Chrome, and Linux operating systems. There are significant challenges with grading sketches, especially when compared to multiple-choice questions. If the grading algorithm is too lenient or too strict, students will lose confidence in the software. The grading algorithm will consider the sketched image, the difficulty of the assignment, and will utilize sketching data from early trials for fine-tuning purposes. Personalized assignments that gradually increase in difficulty as needed, as well as interactive 3D graphics and animations will be provided. A teacher interface will be developed that shows each student's progress down to the detail of each sketch attempt. Additionally, a metric will be developed to quantify student persistence based upon reliance on hints in order to identify which students need more individual mentoring. The scope of this project is the development of the grading algorithm, user interface, assignment and tutorial content, and teacher interface.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves a disruptive change to the solar energy industry by potentially doubling the efficiency of the best available solar cells while, at the same time, significantly reducing their cost. Renewable energy sources are critical to energy independence and, importantly, to the long-term viability of human society which is faced with the inevitable depletion of hydrocarbon based energy sources, such as oil, gas, and coal.

    The proposed project leverages known technologies that are used in physics research, specifically in high energy physics accelerators, such as those found in Fermi National Accelerator Lab or at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The approach is based on using thermo-ionic emission from metals as the source of electric power, in contrast to existing technologies that only use photo-generated currents from more expensive semiconductors. This shift can provide not only higher efficiency, but also a shorter "return-on-energy" which is defined as the time it takes for the device to produce as much energy as was used in its production. The project goal is to demonstrate this new approach by producing a cell that can produce electricity with high efficiency and be measured and evaluated independently by a standards laboratory to validate its result. From this starting point, device optimization and further development will provide a new competing approach to energy independence.

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  A Radical New Alternative to Semiconductor Photodiodes'
- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide the first technical advancement in the specialty metals industry (manufacturers of titanium and nickel) in more than 4 decades. Specialty metals are ubiquitous in our lives, with applications from aircraft parts to medical implants, yet the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process, the work horse for this industry, has remained relatively unchanged since its development in the 1940?s. By coupling the ability to measure the location of electric arcs used for melting these high value alloys in the VAR, with the ability to steer the arcs, substantial electrical savings can be achieved, decreasing costs to the consumer and increasing reliability of the final products. For example, it is well known that the lack of understanding of the dynamics of the process leads to an estimated 8% yield loss, costing the US industry $1.024B per year in lost revenue through yield loss and electrical inefficiency, contributing to the high price of these products. This project proposes to decrease this loss by 50% by developing an applied feedback control technology capable of optimizing the energy distribution within these systems, providing better quality metals at a cheaper production price.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to prove that real-time control can improve plasma-based industrial processing systems. The innovation uses externally applied magnetic fields to manipulate arc position modes during melting operations. By coupling arc position sensing, which measures magnetic field vectors exterior to the process to determine arc positions interior to it, with active manipulation of externally derived fields, arcs can be precisely controlled. Relying upon years of development and validation of arc position sensing, coupled with Finite Element Analysis simulations and experimental validation, this technology will become the first active control of arc melting systems. The significant realization is that spatial and temporal control of the diffuse current paths can be controlled precisely if the validated measurement system of current location is coupled with external field generators. This effort will focus on the application to VAR furnaces but may have significant application to other processes with diffuse current pathways such as Joule heated systems, fuel cells, additive manufacturing or industrial microwave processing. The expected impact of arc control during melting is a reduction in manufacturing defects, an enablement of the production of ingots with increasing diameter, a reduction in energy required in alloy production, and improved safety of operations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its provision of a novel ranging capability whose quality, ease of placement, and scale in deployment will introduce new opportunities in robot operation in situations where there is uncertainty in the relative positions of parts and robots. These include small-batch production (where fixturing cannot be made cost effective), inspection and repair in confined spaces (where 3D sensing must be carried aboard the actuator), hazardous situations (where human presence incurs risk to life), and collaborative interaction with people (where inadvertent contact must be avoided). In the proposed development, robot grasp will be empowered with dynamic 3D range mapping at each fingertip, enabling direct computation of trajectories and velocities tailored to the geometry and structure about to be manipulated.  Extension of the technology to the larger challenge of 3D vision and object modeling offers economic impact in diverse applications.  These include autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle navigation (drones, cars), virtual reality and augmented reality interfaces, 3D teleconferencing and communication, cultural site modeling, and immersive cinema.  Each is an area where increases in reliability and precision with decreases in power and computational cost can bring an application over the threshold in price/performance, into viability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish a new level of real-time passive visual perception in near-range for robot operation, providing 3D data for accurate, precise and rapid grasp. Binocular imaging systems have not demonstrated success in near range robotics due to the inability of their match-based methods to deliver reliable depth measures in complex settings where disparity range is large. Current methods using a few cameras are based on matching so make mistakes, use search that is exponential in covered range so are expensive, and deliver parsimonious descriptions of the world (point clouds) so are weak in descriptive power.  All of these diminish the reliability of their processing and the utility of their analysis in real-world applications.  The technology of this project combined with recent wafer-level integration module packages overcomes these limitations through use of dense sampling, extended baselines, and maintaining and exploiting image spatial continuity. The technical challenge involves mechanical and electrical design to enable micro light-field ranging with analysis on an embedded processor, near-field calibration of imagers/optics/system, and coordination of these with robot control for assessing measurement accuracy and precision. The project will result in high-quality frame-rate light-field ranging on a robot fingertip.

    This SBIR Phase I project will produce a Virtual Reality (VR)-based multiplayer game in which high school-aged players must collaboratively think through and solve complex, authentic Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM)-based problems. The United States faces a shortage of degreed STEM workers. More than half of high school students have indicated that they aren't pursuing STEM degrees or careers because they feel unprepared for or unaware of the opportunities available to them. Further, many students indicate they're interested in science and crave engaging, real-world experiences, but feel that they have limited authentic STEM opportunities in school. There is a need for experiences that engage students in authentic collaborative STEM thinking, and this project seeks to provide them with a compelling virtual problem space using VR. This project also seeks to provide educators with an accessible technology pathway to bring premium VR hardware into schools. Though VR has been heralded as a transformative technology, it currently faces expense and scalability hurdles for in-school use. By leveraging a mixture of technologies and role-based multiplayer, this project will create the virtual context to help players see problems as solvable through reason, experimentation, and collaboration - the heart of STEM philosophy. Players will work together, sharing their knowledge and expertise, running experiments, and solving difficult, compelling science problems.


    The core technical innovation of this project is the design and deployment methodology that will make premium Virtual Reality (VR) experiences a practical tool for schools. The project will result in a multiplayer experience in which one player uses the VR headset to act as the field agent, supported by 5-25 other students using traditional devices with role-based interfaces to act as mission control. By developing asymmetrical (but equally compelling) play experiences, the project will engage all students in collaborative Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM) problem-solving. There are three main problems that this project must solve for educators: the hardware problem (VR hardware is expensive, difficult to scale to more than one student at a time, and requires installation and maintenance); the ambitious pedagogy problem (providing hands-on discovery and inquiry experiences that allow for meaningful collaboration and problem-solving); and the embodiment problem (students need to feel personally invested in the problems we devise if the experience is to be meaningful and transformational). The research goals are 1) To determine whether STEM-based scenarios can be generated with sufficient depth to engage a group of high school-age students in collaborative, interdisciplinary thought and problem-solving across both field agent and mission control roles; and 2) To determine whether the multiplayer role-play experiences produce significant improvements in STEM content knowledge and disposition among players. In order to measure these goals, multiple usability and feasibility tests will be conducted in authentic formal educational environments. Each test will be accompanied by a pre- and post-test that measures both content knowledge and disposition.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide patients with a new gastrointestinal therapeutic device for the alleviation of postoperative ileus (POI) and the restoration of gastrointestinal motility. POI is an impairment of gastrointestinal motility that often develops following abdominal surgery and causes significant discomfort and comorbidities to both patients and their families. Existing solutions in the prevention or treatment of POI based on management strategies and pharmaceutical therapies have limited efficacy and are highly anecdotal. There is also no effective way for clinicians to quantitatively monitor the severity and resolution of POI.  The project is valuable and timely, and it represents a significant departure from the status quo. The success of this project would not only benefit the patients undergoing abdominal surgery and their families, but also would significantly reduce the health care expenditure in the United States by shortening the hospitalization stay as well as the associated medical resources. The developed technologies can be further served as research tools for various biomedical applications to investigate underlying biological mechanisms and the feasibility study of novel treatment method for different diseases.

    The proposed project is to develop and demonstrate a wireless extra-luminal closed-loop gastrointestinal modulation device, capable of simultaneously neuromodulating the gastrointestinal tract and recording gastrointestinal motility wirelessly for alleviating POI, resulting in enhancing gastrointestinal motility.  POI costs over US $1.5 billion annually to its healthcare system. Safely shortening this length of stay by one day would produce significant dividends, leading to a market size of more than $700 million annually. The proposed project will address not only the design and optimization of a bioelectronic device, but also the integration and miniaturization of the wireless gastrointestinal therapeutic device. Animal study is to be conducted to validate the efficacy of the device in modulating and wirelessly recording of gastrointestinal motility, and its safety and reliability. If successful, the outcome will lead to a new bioelectronics medicine that advances the treatment of POI, and can be potentially expanded to other medical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be observed through a direct reduction in the energy consumption required by large industrial facilities, commercial buildings, campuses, and homes. Due to reduced cooling demands as a result of carefully designed radiative properties, the sustainability of federal and industry facilities will be significantly improved with the installation of PRC roofing material for building energy management. A complementary function of PRC roofing is found with the potential for enhanced condensation from the ultra-cool surface, presenting the ability to integrate PRC for improved rooftop water harvesting, directly impacting critical water supply issues and the expensive effects of drought on regional agriculture. The market demand for cool roofing materials has exceeded $750M, annually, and is expected to grow with recent energy regulations. PRC roofing material can expect to compete in a growing industry due to non-trivial improvement over state-of-the-art options in commercial cool roofing products and the economic fabrication method identified in the PRC conceptual design stage. Opportunities extend beyond structural thermal management to facilities dedicated to condensation of atmospheric water vapor in isolated regions without access to satisfactory water supplies, and portable use for emergency water harvesting.

    The proposed project will provide the critical design, testing, and experimental validation needed to transition PRC technology into the commercial sector. Designs based on electromagnetic and thermal modeling include composite material options capable of providing passive radiative flux of over 100 Watts per square meter of installed material. This passive cooling advantage?relative to current commercial cool roofing materials?is expected to create significant long-term cost-savings and reduction in fossil fuel usage for climate controlled structures. PRC material properties designed to be selective across the ultraviolet-visible-infrared spectrum offer the opportunity for intelligent thermal management through reflection of visible and near-infrared portions of the radiative spectrum, while emitting strongly in the 8-13 ìm atmospheric transmission window. A primary objective of the SBIR project is to optimize PRC designs considering full spectrum properties with three criteria in mind: thermal efficiency improvement, prototype fabrication, and large batch manufacturing economy. The second primary objective is sub-scale fabrication and spectral characterization of the PRC roofing material. Subsequent demonstration of a functional PRC sample with quantified passive cooling power is key to the goals of attracting licensing clients and/or investments for commercial-grade manufacturing.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will research the feasibility of a cloud-based,
    collaborative authoring tool to achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction in technical
    skills required to author technology-enhanced assessments (TEAs). Additionally,
    it will seek to advance the frontiers of TEA authoring beyond individual assessments
    to encompass the creation of personalized TEA pathways for diverse learners. The
    effort will explore novel technologies including a symbolic abstraction to enable
    visual design and implementation of complex programming constructs, and the representation
    of TEAs as \"intelligent objects\" interoperable with disparate and proprietary
    assessment platforms. This effort seeks to break the stranglehold of large organizations
    on a growing assessments market that marginalizes educators due to barriers of
    cost and technology skills. It will empower educators by making available easy-to-use
    tools that enable creation and sharing of open TEAs and TEA pathways to support
    deeper learning at scale, allowing educators to distribute TEAs in a classroom
    without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system, triggering the evolution
    of a peer-to-peer marketplace for teacher-created assessments. This disruption
    bears the potential to empower educator communities at scale and impact all learners
    in secondary and tertiary education settings through equitable access to quality
    assessments. \n\nThis project will feature two distinctive innovations. The first
    is a visual programming environment with symbolic abstraction of complex programming
    constructs that are imperative for the design and creation of TEAs. This will
    enable intuitive authoring of complex TEAs by non-programmers (an impossibility
    today) and break down the biggest friction point for achieving access to TEAs
    at scale. The second is an open format for representation of TEAs as intelligent
    objects that are platform agnostic and \"embeddable\" in any assessment delivery
    system. This will facilitate distribution and usage of TEAs in browsers and thin
    client environments without the need for server side functionality mandated by
    proprietary systems. This will eventually break the stranglehold of proprietary
    assessment delivery systems that tie TEA access to their platforms. The project
    will pursue two primary research questions: How efficient and useful is the TEA
    authoring experience for non-technical educators? Are the TEAs effective in eliciting
    targeted reasoning and thinking processes? These research questions will help
    validate the technical feasibility of our innovative use of the proposed tool
    to enable easy TEA creation and distribution, and the efficacy of the complex
    TEAs created using the proposed project in providing evidence of target learning."

    digital tools designed to promote parent/caregiver-mediated dialogic reading routines
    in children ages 6 months to 5 years. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been
    shown to foster virtually all school-readiness indicators from cognitive and social-emotional
    development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. Research demonstrates
    that science learning should also be cultivated before kindergarten entry, so
    children begin formal schooling with age-appropriate content and conceptual knowledge
    and the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The increase of income
    inequality in the US underscores the urgency of closing ever-widening achievement
    gaps between children living in poverty and more affluent peers. Investments in
    early childhood have been shown to remediate educational deficits, so a cost-effective,
    home-based method of guiding parents and caregivers in a dialogic reading process
    can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps, the precursor
    to persistent achievement gaps, and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages
    they perpetuate. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and
    growing. Purchasers in this market include institutions (e.g., preschools, Head
    Start, social-service agencies, libraries), community initiatives, healthcare
    professionals working with families of young children, as well as individual families.\n
    \nThis project will build a complex technology systems architecture to sell, distribute,
    manage, and evaluate educative materials on commonly available digital devices
    of all form factors. The product uses a proprietary system to build hybrid reading
    selections with separate visible layers targeted for the two audiences - children
    and the adults reading to them. This approach engages both audiences, while providing
    actionable and effective guidance for caregivers for whom dialogic reading may
    be a new or not yet habitual practice. Along with layered selections, a key innovation
    employed by this project will be a set of proprietary algorithms that learns from
    user behavior and tailors the program to the needs of each individual. To further
    increase efficacy, this project will include a secure data-sharing portal to allow
    institutional clients to evaluate school readiness among their constituencies
    and to manage their programs accordingly. A robust content management system will
    support a variety of sales options and allow for dynamic updates and additions
    to the system content. Finally, an engagement system based on behavioral psychology
    will be developed to promote application stickiness aimed at building routines
    of reading and dialogic thinking."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a new class of soft, flexible, nonabrasive
    sensing elements which provide precise temperature readings to positively impact
    the health and mobility of diabetic patients. The principle impetus of this research
    is to focus primarily on advanced diabetic patients who suffer from nerve damage
    to their feet. These patients cannot feel their feet, leading to two important
    and related results. First, they are at high risk for an increased number of undetected
    ulcerating injuries from tissue damage produced by walking (friction) or standing
    (pressure).  Second, since these injuries are undetected and unfelt, there is
    a decreased urgency by the patient to seek medical care.  Delays in medical intervention
    further exacerbate injuries and complicate treatment, leading to an economic burden
    associated with foot ulceration estimated at $15 billion annually. More importantly,
    the 5-year mortality rate after first ulceration (40%) approaches mortality rates

    is designed to reside daily in a patient?s shoe to record temperatures while the
    patient experiences damaging activity such as walking or standing, alerting the
    patient to impending tissue injury. The sensor can also reside daily in a patient?s
    medical-treatment cast, providing a constant readout of skin temperature indicating
    tissue healing, allowing for out-patient monitoring and decreasing repeated visits

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes reliable and consistent fluid resuscitation (i.e., intravenous administration of fluids) for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) requiring fluid management. The goal of fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients is to restore blood volume in the circulatory system to an acceptable level in order to ensure adequate tissue perfusion (i.e., blood delivery to tissue). However, large intrapatient and interpatient variability in physiological parameters as well as the effect of different illnesses and medications can result in under- and over-resuscitation of ICU patients by the clinical staff. Optimal fluid resuscitation is especially critical for the recovery of patients with severe sepsis (i.e., patients with sepsis and acute organ dysfunction) or septic shock (i.e., patients with sepsis and persistent or refractory hypotension or tissue hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid resuscitation). In these patients, ineffective arterial circulation due to vasodilation (i.e., dilation of blood vessels) and capillary leakage (i.e., increased distribution of fluids into the interstitial space) needs to be compensated by fluid management.

    The proposed project involves developing a clinical decision support system for fluid resuscitation for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU. Specifically, a cloud-based clinical decision support system will be developed, which will use continuous measurements from hemodynamic monitoring devices to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid management. In this project, a clinical decision support algorithm that will guide the clinician in fluid management will be developed and a clinical study at our partner hospital will be performed. A critical drawback with using a model-based approach to compute the patient's fluid requirement is that accurate parameter values are needed for the model. However, high-fidelity models do not exist and current models cannot fully account for the physiology and response of the patient to fluids. The proposed framework does not need any patient-specific information (e.g., age, gender, weight, diagnosis, concomitant medication, etc.). Furthermore, the framework does not require an accurate model of the patient dynamics and the patient specific physiological parameters.

    This SBIR Phase I project will research and develop new functional materials for advanced additive manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop high performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the goal of lowering the barriers to innovation.


    polySpectra has developed a new class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production quality parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This process is called functional lithography - it unlocks the ability to simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys. The goal of this project is to discover and develop new materials using functional lithography, to push the limits of the materials that are available in additive manufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will pave the way for new types of social network analysis to detect anomalies, which could lead to more accurate and faster identification of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA), key opinion leaders (i.e., influentials), and market segments.  Medicare and other healthcare providers lose hundreds of millions of dollars to FWA.  This research proposes using a novel way to discover and combine relationships between entities (e.g., doctors) with information about the entities (e.g., prescription history) using machine learning.  The goal is to reduce a claims investigator's workload while maintaining high accuracy in detecting FWA.  In short, the results of this research will not only improve FWA detection efficiency, but enable detecting new types of FWA.  Societal impact includes reduced costs to the taxpayer for government supported programs such as Medicare through better FWA detection. More broadly, the system could be used to find terrorist and crime networks, detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under-medication, over-medication, and even incorrect medications.

    The proposed project will apply a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities such as doctors with information about doctors (e.g., a doctor's prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by developing a new way to automatically discover those relations and then combining those relations with the information about doctors through machine learning, thus vastly improving prediction accuracy. The method uses relation information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa. It is believed that this method will hugely improve the ability to detect FWA. The goal is to achieve a 50% true positive rate in a database of fraud-convicted doctors published monthly by the government.  The scope of the project involves analyzing several different types of health insurance claims formats (e.g., Medicare) and producing a fraud score, which then others can use. The anticipated results include a fraud score for most doctors in the U.S. (at least those who deal with Medicare), APIs to these scores, and an interactive visual system that claims investigators can use to reduce their workload while accurately identifying FWA.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will enable biomolecular research by developing a high precision micropump utilizing a magnetic shape memory (MSM) mechanism. The MSM mechanism translates magnetic energy into mechanical work through an MSM alloy. The MSM material replaces many of the mechanical parts found in other micropump technologies and can precisely manipulate the very small fluid volumes handled by many researchers, such as biomolecular physicists and electro-neurophysiologists. Precision micro-dosing will decrease the costs of such research by decreasing the volume of reagents consumed and by increasing the efficacy and efficiency of experiments. This project will develop laboratory instrumentation for the institutional research market and will later expand to enter the nearly $3 billion microfluidic devices market. It will further develop MSM technology that will translate to multiple markets including healthcare. The broader impacts range from improvements in personalized medicine through point-of-care diagnostics, to the development of more efficient drugs, for example in cancer treatment, through enhanced pharmaceutical research.

    The intellectual merit of this project focuses on increasing the pumping resolution of the MSM micropump for precision micro-dosing for laboratory research. The pump design is biomimetic and works similarly to how mammals swallow. By applying a magnetic field, a peristaltic motion is generated in the MSM material which can be used to repeatedly pump precise quantities of fluid. This technology boasts a unique combination of features including (1) contact-free magnetic actuation, (2) no mechanical parts, (3) combination of the pumping mechanism and valve into a single element, (4) reversibility of the flow direction, (5) operation even with a high back pressure, (6) applicability to gases and viscous liquids, and (7) high precision at small volumes. Reducing the size of the MSM magneto-mechanical transducer will increase the pumping resolution. Since the surface-area-to-volume ratio is larger for smaller MSM transducers, surface stresses must be controlled more delicately. One key outcome of this work will be the development of surface treatment methods to improve magneto-mechanical fatigue life and the performance of the device. Through systematic experiments, this project will establish fundamental processing-structure-properties-performance relationships for MSM transducers, and will also demonstrate prototype devices for biomolecular research.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a commercially-viable human cell-based model to screen experimental drugs for their efficacy in treating myelin disorders. Current screening methods used in the R&D of new drugs fail to successfully predict translation from discovery to clinical success. This absence results in high attrition rates, increased development time, and significant R&D costs, most acutely in neurological applications. Pharmaceutical companies devote up to 15 years and spend over $2B to bring a single drug to market. On average, 89% of drugs entering clinical trials fail, while drugs targeting the central nervous system (CNS) fail at a rate of 92%, due largely to the poor predictive validity of current animal models. As a case study of demyelinating diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS) affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States and 2.5 million people worldwide. MS therapeutics represent a $17.2B global market, with an estimated late-stage preclinical testing market of $50M annually. Development of the proposed screening platform has the potential to better predict clinical efficacy, while substantially reducing the time and cost associated with developing new drugs for MS and other demyelinating disorders, accelerating treatments for millions of patients.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to establish the technical feasibility of using a 3D model of living nerve/brain tissue for screening drugs to treat disorders of myelin, the fatty encasement surrounding nerve axons. The project aims to build on preliminary work to include cells relevant to the central nervous system. It will then be shown that myelination, demyelination, and remyelination can be assessed using clinically-relevant, physiological metrics. The final goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a humanized assay, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, a renewable source of human cells. The resultant model system will be truly unique, comprised of human cells in an anatomical arrangement that mimics living nerve tissue, unlocking the potential for clinically-relevant metrics far earlier in the drug development lifecycle.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a cutting-edge nanotechnology
    that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such
    as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential
    to changing regenerative healthcare forever. It would change biobanking for on-demand
    cells and tissues and improve mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical
    procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all
    levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment
    of a final product to patient. Yet, critically, the field lacks the ability to
    safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines severely limiting
    product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable
    than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient
    (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or
    transport distances. More people will die from premature organ failure than cancer.
    \ Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will
    significantly enhance national healthcare.  The US faces strong commercial and
    competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including
    organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant
    savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies
    with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly
    $250 billion per year in the U.S.\n  \n\nThe cytotoxicity of current biopreservation
    techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water
    delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage
    from ice formation. The goal of this project is to establish a fundamentally different
    approach to cryoprotective agent optimization by developing first-in-the-field
    bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient
    intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation.
    Past research has demonstrated the reliability of constructing well-defined nanotubular
    assemblies via the enforced stacking of shape-persistent macrocycles based on
    the interplay of multiple hydrogen-bonding, dipole-dipole, and aromatic pi-pi
    stacking interactions and their self-insertion into lipid bilayers. These rationally
    designed organic nanopores will serve as selective transmembrane channels when
    protein channels malfunction at or below 3 °C. As a result, the cell's exposure
    time to reach ice-free cryopreservation temperature will be significantly reduced.
    Post-preservation cell yield and viability will be greatly improved by reducing
    intracellular ice formation. Upon rewarming, these organic nanopores will facilitate
    rapid removal of the cryoprotective agents. At physiological temperature, the
    nanopores will seal off, and be washed out from the system resulting in low toxicity.
    Nanopore function and effect will be examined using liposome-based glucose transport,
    cell-based toxicity and cell-based cryopreservation assays."

    kitting and stitching machine.  This demonstration machine will be capable of
    placing, cutting and securing 6 layers of dry composite material in parallel.
    \ The parallel nature of the process greatly improves manufacturing time, while
    the reel-to-reel capable layout of the machine allows for manufacturing of long
    continuous laminates using a comparatively small machine footprint.  The key technical
    hurdles will be software control and mechanical management of multiple parallel
    plies.  During this research project Green Dynamics will demonstrate the proposed
    machine control proposal and mechanical system layout, which allows multiple plies
    to spool in parallel and be cut on individual gantries simultaneously.  The Green
    Dynamics lamination kitting and stitching machine will demonstrate the labor and
    cost savings that can be achieved through automated manufacturing of a single
    piece laminate.  These savings will enable the continued reduction in cost for
    composite materials, and spur their growth into new markets. Decreasing the cost
    and improving the quality of composite structures such as wind turbine blades
    and automotive components is a key path to lower carbon emissions. \n\n\nThe proposed
    manufacturing machine handles multiple fabric rolls in parallel and uses proprietary
    control algorithms and fabric handling methods to cut and secure up to 6 layers
    of material simultaneously. As individual layers are processed independently the
    resulting laminate stack is highly tailored and places material only where it
    is needed. The final product is transportable, and for very long length parts,
    can be rolled up to minimize transport size. At the manufacturing location this
    laminate is placed in the tool in a single step, which greatly reduces the time
    to manufacture the part and the process time in the tool. No other composite automation
    machine can provide a single piece lamination which is tailored in multiple directions.
    The resulting laminate effectively uses the orthotropic properties of composite
    materials to achieve lower weights while enabling much lower touch labor rates.
    The multi-roll, linear orientation of our machine allows for reel to reel processing
    of long narrow laminates in a small machine footprint, and results in a rolled,
    transportable laminate."

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a working prototype for an interactive search and visualization tool that redefines how social scientists and business practitioners interested in scholarly research findings identify such findings. Instead of reading through numerous, unstructured, and often irrelevant text results (such as those produced by traditional academic search engines), users get to (a) instantly view and easily navigate research findings via intuitively-structured, clickable visual maps, and (b) accurately identify those papers most relevant to them, thanks to semantically intelligent indexing and visual reconciliation. This efficiency-enhancing tool makes research findings substantially easier to understand and explore, while drastically cutting down search times for such findings (to half or even less) which will ultimately enhance the efficiency of research endeavors at U.S. universities. Moreover, various inquiries have shown that practitioners in applied fields such as marketing or management place high value on academic research in the social sciences, yet often find such research difficult to understand. The proposed solution distills social science findings into an easily digestible format, hence facilitating the knowledge transfer between academia and businesses, and enhancing the value of academic research to society. Finally, by being marketed as a subscription-based service to both academics and business practitioners, the proposed tool has the potential to generate substantial commercial value in the long term (up to $50 million in annual revenue).

    The proposed tool fundamentally alters the existing search paradigm in the social sciences, by changing both the way in which research findings from academic papers are indexed, and how such findings are visually presented. It combines an innovation on the back-end (i.e., using Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to automatically extract concepts and causal relationships from academic research papers, and semantically categorize those concepts against a set of discipline-specific thesauri) with an innovation on the front-end (i.e., using aggregate causal mapping to represent the academic literature in the form of interactive maps that can be visually explored and narrowed down in order to precisely locate relevant papers). The main research objective is to test the feasibility of (1) using NLU for accurately identifying and extracting the underlying concepts/variables and causal structure of the studies described in a large set of social science research papers (approximately 1,000 published papers), and of (2) automatically rendering the extracted information in the form of causal maps that both academic and non-academic users can intuitively understand and navigate. This research objective has been reached if a group of test users employ the proposed tool to successfully identify research papers examining particular concepts and relationships, and do so in about half the time needed when using a traditional academic search engine for the same task.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to reduce pathogenic salmonella carriage in poultry. The challenge addressed is the one of foodborne bacterial gastrointestinal infections. These infections are significant causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Of alarming concern is the emergence of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. A major source of drug-resistance development is the widespread use of antibiotics in animal production. An estimated 70% of all antibiotics produced in the US are administered to livestock, primarily to promote growth and improve feed efficiency, even in the absence of infection. This sub-therapeutic administration of antibiotics to animals creates a vast reservoir for the selection of drug-resistant bacteria.  As a potential solution to this problem, probiotic bacteria will be engineered that express and secrete antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of animals. In this application, the focus is on chickens, a significant source of animal protein in diets around the globe. Foodborne Salmonella infects millions of people in the US every year, and the major source of Salmonella poisoning are poultry products. The goal is to reduce carriage of Salmonella in chickens to ensure safe food and reduce the need for antibiotics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess a new, transformative antibiotic technology. Antibiotic, AMP-producing probiotics will be used to reduce pathogens in poultry intestines. Pathogens in poultry intestines are considered the major source of contamination of poultry meat during processing. AMPs are small proteins with remarkable bactericidal properties. Probiotics will be tested as AMP-delivery vehicles. Probiotics are bile-resistant microorganisms that can be delivered safely in food or water. Synthetic biological DNA promoter regions will be employed to precisely control the delivery of AMPs at the site of infection. The impact of controllable AMP delivery will be examined in poultry challenged by Salmonella Enteritidis, a common foodborne pathogen. The impact will be examined for live biotherapeutic bacteria on the microbiota present in the GI tracts of poultry. This project will result in the following advances in discovery/development: 1) Discovery of antimicrobial peptides that selectively target Salmonella spp. 2) Development of peptide expression and secretion cassettes for probiotics; 3) Development of probiotics that competitively inhibit the growth of Salmonella spp.; 4) Development of probiotics that may be supplied safely to farm animals; and 5) Development of probiotics that positively modulate the gut microbiome of poultry.

    Research (SBIR) project will be to increase wood production of managed loblolly
    pine tree farms by 20%. Global demand for forest industry products, e.g., pulp
    for paper, saw timber, and wood pellets for fuel, is expected to rise 60-100%

    farms will play a large role in supplying the demand. Using a biotechnology gene
    trait approach to introduce cell wall gene technology, the goal is to engineer
    pine trees with 20% more wood density over conventional crops. This may result
    in more wood material per tree, per acre with no added cost to production processing,
    i.e., no increase use of land, water, or fertilizers. As an added benefit, bioengineered
    trees with cell wall gene technologies aid in protecting the environment by sequestering
    more atmospheric CO2 thus helping to combat the negative effects of global climate
    change. Ultimately, this work may lead to the development of renewable materials

    cell wall gene platform technologies, together with ubiquitously expressed and
    secondary wall-specific promoters, to significantly and selectively increase cell
    wall density in loblolly pine. Bioengineered plants will be selected using herbicide
    resistance and the effects of transgene incorporation analyzed through gene expression
    and histochemical analysis. The anticipated outcome of this project will be 400
    bioengineered pine seedlings with greater strength and increased value to be tested
    in greenhouse and field trials once approved. This project will serve as proof-of-concept
    testing for select cell wall gene technologies in commercial tree crops towards
    technology commercialization."

    on off-board processing, the commonly used 2.4 GHz band, and the use of multiple
    wireless links for command transmission result in a slow implementation that is
    sensitive to packet loss and interference.  In safety critical modes of operation,
    such as steering a powered wheelchair, these sources of risk and performance degradation
    are unacceptable.  The proposed research will consolidate key TDS functions within
    a standalone TDS headset that can interface with any target peripheral with a
    direct wireless link.  Hardware redesigns will include a powerful microcontroller
    to onboard sensor data acquisition and signal processing algorithms.  Dual radio
    chipsets will be incorporated to maintain interoperability with commercial devices
    using 2.4 GHz radios, while also supporting less utilized frequency bands for
    safety critical operations.  The result of this research will be a robust AT suitable
    for safely critical deployments."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program will be to develop a technology to convert the acid whey waste generated by Greek yogurt production into a natural sweetener. The Greek yogurt industry is on the rise. However, making authentic Greek yogurt is a wasteful process - producing 3 parts waste for every part of Greek yogurt made. An economical use of Greek yogurt waste will capture the full value of the waste materials, minimize waste transportation cost, decrease bacterial outbreak risk, and reduce the carbon footprint for the environment. In parallel, the technology will ensure a sustainable supply of a rare low-calorie natural sweetener, which was shown to help lower blood sugar and improve cholesterol levels, in addition to its antioxidant, anti-cavity and pro-digestive properties. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of conversion of non-food biomass to value-added chemicals.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to use synthetic biology and metabolic engineering to develop engineered yeast as a self-renewing biocatalyst for processing the environmentally hazardous waste from Greek yogurt production into a low-calorie natural sweetener. Greek yogurt companies struggle to dispose of its waste. The waste, which contains significant amounts of lactose, cannot be discarded without a pretreatment step because it stimulates bacterial growth, polluting water systems. The research addresses this challenge through the development of self-sustained microbes as catalysts in a continuous process, allowing lactose uptake with minimal waste pretreatment. This process produces a low-calorie natural sweetener as a product, whose market supply is currently limited by production cost. Anticipated technical results include strains with high yield and productivity, a specific product purification method and successful assembly of a live yeast reactor. The design overcomes substantial financial, logistical and thermodynamic bottlenecks in Greek yogurt waste treatment, and the low-calorie natural sweetener production.

    to develop an advanced non-contact, non-destructive monitoring technology to reliably
    identify early fatigue damage in pipelines, piping, and tubing. Current industry
    practice relies on statistically based, semi-empirical models that unfortunately
    can have an order of magnitude in error in predicting fatigue life, a leading
    failure mode in metals that are exposed to high cycling, high strain, and/or elevated
    pressures and temperatures. The United States infrastructure relies on millions
    of miles of pipes, pipelines, and tubing that are critical in the transport of
    valuable fluids serving a number of industries including municipal water, production
    and transport of oil and gas, and chemicals in processing plants. Unfortunately,
    this aging infrastructure can fail with disastrous consequences. \nThe successful
    development and commercialization of this new technology will be a great leap
    in integrity monitoring, resulting in significant reduction in costs and delays,
    and eliminating catastrophic failures in the field. The estimated total addressable
    market for pipeline and coil tubing monitoring are in excess of $4 billion annually.\n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this SBIR project centers on the demonstration of the technical
    and economic feasibility of this novel fatigue monitoring technology with a specific
    target of identifying when the material has reached 90% of its actual fatigue
    life. The technology is based on a novel electromagnetic measurement scheme that
    can effectively detect magnetic dislocations in the material which have been shown
    to be early indicators of failure due to fatigue. Using advanced analytics, strong
    correlations between the measured electromagnetic properties and fatigue life
    can provide a direct and reliable identifier of imminent fatigue damage without
    loss of material integrity. The major challenges that this SBIR effort proposes
    to address are (1) engineering an electromagnetic-based measurement technique
    with sufficient sensitivity to detect the magnetic defects seen in early fatigue
    damage under field operating conditions (2) developing appropriate detection algorithms
    to handle the statistical variations affecting fatigue damage and (3) engineering
    a cost-effective monitoring solutions compared with alternative fatigue management
    practices."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this small business Innovative
    Research Phase 1 project is the possibility of inexpensive clean water generation
    from sea and brackish water.  With rapidly increasing world population, portable
    water will be one of the most important technological challenges of this century.
    There is no unique ?one size fits all? approach to desalination. Many factors
    such as salt concentration, the presence of specific ions, energy cost, pretreatment
    requirements and capital investments are important considerations in selecting
    the desalination technology to be implemented. The carbon nanotube enhanced membrane
    distillation proposed here is a relatively low temperature process where industrial
    waste heat and solar heating can be used for desalination. Small water heaters
    such as the natural gas heaters used in homes can be used to generate high quality
    drinking water along with what is needed for domestic consumption. Another major
    application of this technology is in oil and gas drilling. Hydraulic fracturing
    or fracking is a water-intensive process. A typical frack well uses several million
    gallons of water over its lifetime and generates a highly saline ?produced water?.
    \  With its ability to handle high salt concentrations, the proposed approach
    is a viable alternative for treating this waste.  \n\nThe technical objectives
    in this project are to utilize carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to create breakthrough
    membrane properties for desalination via membrane distillation (MD). In MD, a
    hydrophobic porous membrane separates a hot salt water feed and a cold permeate
    stream.  As the heated brine passes on the membrane and is partially transformed
    to water vapor. The hydrophobicity of the membrane prevents the aqueous solution
    from entering the pores. However, freed from hydrogen bonding the water vapor
    passes through and is condensed on the permeate side of the membrane. The novel
    membranes referred to as carbon nanotube immobilized membranes (CNIM) will be
    developed by immobilizing CNTs into membrane pores where they will serve as molecular
    transporters and sorbents, thus providing additional pathways for water vapor
    transport. The other major advantage of CNIM is that it is less prone to fouling
    than conventional membranes. Key innovations of the proposal include the functionalization
    of CNTs for maximization of water vapor transport while minimizing fouling.  Additional
    objectives include the study of fouling behavior of some commercially important
    water samples such as sea water, power plant effluents and produced water. Finally,
    a process optimization tool will be developed to optimize CNIM-MD design."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-Level inverter, an integrated 48kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy.  The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault-tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

    of monomers is a current challenge in chemistry. Proteins are natural polymers,
    and are specific sequences of amino acids put together easily and efficiently
    by the living cell. The NSF Center for Genomically Encoded Materials (C-GEM) takes
    a bio-inspired approach making a sequence of synthetic polymers by re-engineering
    the cell's systems.  In this case, the cell becomes a new translational machine
    that synthesizes new chemical polymers of specific sequence and length. NSF C-GEM
    establishes a new, transformative field of chemistry and fosters innovation at
    the chemistry-biology-materials frontier. The applications of the new materials
    with novel properties range from information storage to anti-counterfeiting and
    drug delivery, from environmental remediation to drug discovery. NSF C-GEM engages
    scientists and non-scientists in a variety of research and educational activities,
    including improved communication to the public. These education and participation
    programs integrate research with training to establish a diverse chemical workforce.
    NSF C-GEM presents a new online platform and data management system, GEM-Net,
    to promote data sharing within and outside the research team. NSF C-GEM is also
    developing an online video game that allows citizen scientists to participate
    in the research process and track results. \n\nThe NSF Center for Genomically
    Encoded Materials, NSF C-GEM, is focused on the challenge of preparing polymers
    whose monomers and dispersity are defined with protein-like control. Sequence-defined
    polymers possess extraordinary potential for information storage, anti-counterfeiting,
    drug delivery, environmental remediation, and even drug discovery, but strategies
    to prepare them are barely in their infancy. NSF C-GEM's approach synthesizes
    sequence-defined chemical polymers by repurposing the E. coli translational apparatus.
    The translation machinery, which normally promotes bond formation between alpha-amino
    acids, now promotes bond-forming reactions between monomers that are the building
    blocks for aramids, polyolefins, polyurethanes, and other polymers. The approach
    demands orthogonal enzymes that acylate orthogonal tRNAs with each monomer, efficiently
    and in vivo; orthogonal ribosomes that accept these tRNAs as substrates and elongate
    the products; genomically-recoded organisms with multiple open codons to enable
    mRNA-templated synthesis of sequence-defined polymers; and high-resolution structural
    data to deepen understanding and inform design. The project develops the multi-disciplinary
    tools and technologies that demonstrate the proof of concept of the approach and
    establish practical methodologies to this aim. NSF C-GEM fosters innovation at
    the chemistry-biology-materials frontier, and engages scientists and non-scientists
    in research and educational activities. A diverse set of education and participation
    programs integrates research with training, establishes a diverse chemical workforce,

    This project entails the build out of the simulation engine for a touch-based, mobile game designed to intuitively teach the basics of electricity and magnetism to children aged 5+.  The mobile game gives users a picture of what?s happening inside a circuit, and allows them to play with the charges, electric and magnetic forces, voltage, capacitors, transistors, etc.  The use of funds from this NSF SBIR Grant would include the research and development required to build and incorporate this simulator into the game.  This simulator is novel, is customized for educational use, must be extraordinarily fast, and is based on Maxwell?s Equations, the four equations that govern all of electricity and magnetism.  The successful completion of this project will create a new way of teaching electricity and magnetism to children, giving them a visual understanding of the concepts.  The goal is to make science and engineering more attainable subjects to pursue in higher education.  This will lead to an increase in the number of science and engineering graduates in the US, and help to close the international educational achievement gap, which experts agree represents over a $1T overall opportunity loss.  Besides having a profound effect on the US economy, this also benefits the individual.  In 2014, the DOE reported that the median starting income of a STEM (engineering) graduate was $74,000, almost $25,000 more than a non-STEM graduate.

    The proposed real-time, interactive, multi-touch-based simulator would be the first of its kind; no combined two-dimensional field and circuit simulator exists today, particularly for use in an educational game.  This combined simulator only has 16 milliseconds to update its results, whereas a typical two-dimensional field solver could take minutes to hours to solve.  By using a novel simulator architecture and by focusing on speed and conceptual understanding at the necessary precision, the game simulator will be able to achieve the over 100x speed-up required.  The simulator needs to solve Maxwell?s equations and thus calculate and display the electromagnetic physics behavior at 60 frames per second, the rate required for interactive gaming. Several approaches are used to accomplish this.  This simulator is built from the ground up, with a unique choice of variables that prioritizes qualitative understanding over the circuit size and accuracy requirements of an industrial simulator.  The simulator focuses on components and circuits commonly used in teaching.  The simulator also utilizes the combined central/graphics processing hardware available in modern mobile devices.  With this simulator as the core gaming engine, the company is building a game where children as young as five can experiment with and intuitively understand the basics of electricity, magnetism, and circuits.

    This project researches and develops a novel mathematics communication and collaboration system. Mathematics is the foundation of Science and Technology, and national competence in the STEM fields is essential to maintaining our competitive edge on a global scale. Math literacy hinges on effective communication of mathematical concepts and processes. However, despite significant advances in pedagogical methods, the way we communicate mathematics remains curiously behind the times. Preliminary customer and market research has revealed that the lack of adequate communication tools for mathematical and technical expressions is holding back the advance of mathematics in online environments such as online tutoring. Moreover, the scarcity of effective communication tools has reinforced the long-standing preconception that math is primarily a solitary activity, and it has created an unintended and harmful selection bias restricting the diversity of students entering STEM fields. This project fills the void of adequate math communications tools with an dynamic, interactive system for communicating mathematical derivations in real-time in an online environment. The system facilitates student-student and student-teacher remote communication of mathematics, and it is particularly suited for student-tutor communication on online tutoring platforms.

    The math communication and collaboration system this project develops leverages the company's proprietary equation manipulation technology. This system employs an integrated math engine and a touch-based interface allowing users to manipulate equations using simple drag-and-drop gestures. It is built on a game-engine allowing for multi-player support. This project integrates the equation manipulation technology into a networked multi-user interface to connect one or more users for real-time communication of mathematical derivations. The project researches the precise needs of students, teachers, and online tutors to tailor the user interface to the specific needs of online mathematics communication. Specific problems the project researches include multi-player networking and matchmaking functionality, optimal network architecture for the system, transfer of control between users for effective communication, integration of traditional communication tools within the system, and reduction of latency time to enhance real-time interactivity. Successful completion of the project will result in a first-of-its-kind math communication system that allows users in different places to connect online and communicate a mathematical derivation as it is happening, and as easily as if they were in the same room. The primary project deliverable is a minimum viable product to be piloted and vetted through the company?s existing math app.

    diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder by improving eye contact. Children with
    Autism Spectrum Disorder do not make eye contact readily and eye contact is a
    key component in progressing social behavior. Current methodologies to assist
    these children in maximizing their capabilities are out of reach for many, costing
    families thousands of dollars a month, requiring 25-40 hours per week and offer
    measureable improvements at less than 47%. This project has shown positive results
    in preliminary testing and is expected to result in an affordable, practical solution
    to the challenges children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and their families encounter.
    As their social skills improve, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder will be
    able to build and maintain friendships, become more fully engaged in society,
    prepare them to become self-sustaining adults, and increase their employment opportunities.
    Additionally, this program can also be expanded to children with other disabilities
    or children without disabilities, resulting in increased ability to also build
    and maintain friendships, become more fully engaged in society to prepare them
    to become self-sustaining adults, and increase their employment opportunities.
    Potential customers will include parents, school districts, and other professional
    and nonprofessional caregivers. The high need for this program will create market
    growth, creating new jobs and generating tax revenue. \n\nThe goal for this project
    is to develop a multi-sensory program, developed for smart mobile devices, that
    improves children with Autism Spectrum Disorder?s social skills so they can function
    as their typical peers who do not have Autism Spectrum Disorder. This goal is
    accomplished by developing an interactive program that teaches the social skill,
    making eye contact with individuals the child does and does not know, by improving
    sensory integration and regulating the overactive amygdala. Funding would allow
    for the development of the program to test, measure and quantify sensory integration
    and eye contact improvement for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Analyses
    will reflect the interpretation requirements of a Pre vs. Post, Intervention versus
    Control design. All statistical analyses and tests will be conducted using the
    widely used program Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 17 or
    higher and will be verified with Statistical Analysis System when appropriate
    or marginal findings."

    a major problem, because the social and content channels are disconnected. Collaboration
    currently happens through email or shared text documents that are separated from
    the relevant segments in the video being discussed. This disconnect hampers in-depth
    communication and leads to errors. This project's focus is to integrate video
    content and collaborative discussion on the same page with multiple annotation
    features so that discussion and collaboration can be as detailed and efficient
    as with a shared text document. The increasing importance and proliferation of
    video in the educational arena and other domains strategically places this project
    at the vanguard of scientific discovery in building a technology tool that will
    serve society. Outside the field of education, this project will impact workplaces
    where videos are used by individuals or groups as part of training, analysis or
    assessment such as corporate/manufacturing, legal/criminal justice, medical and
    others. The project holds a patent and is situated as a spin-out from a university.
    It has unlimited potential for national and international commercialization, thus

    metrics for video engagement monitoring. The goal of the project is to address
    knowledge gaps identified in tools to support video-centered collaboration, targeting
    the flipped classroom model for STEM higher education. In this context it is essential
    to understand and support best practice mechanisms for automated group creation,
    bidirectional discourse proliferation for large class sizes and measurement of
    engagement and effectiveness for video content. The project's subaward team will
    be responsible for development and testing of technical feasibility aspects of
    the proposed research milestones. For each of the research milestones, the team
    will analyze the data from prototype deployments at the University and from other
    beta testers. Formative evaluation will be conducted through analysis of log files,
    informal interviews and focus groups with beta testers. Based on the feedback,
    a coded prototype will be created and tested on the test server before final deployment

    manner. These technologies include wireless communications systems now available
    on low-cost touch tablets, as well as powerful, inexpensive microprocessors that
    enable small, custom hardware kits to communicate with such tablets. By combining
    the sensing of environmental values such as light and sound levels with motors,
    lights and other output expressions, this kit will provide a chance for students
    to think at the systems level. They will create interactive sculptural robots
    and connect systems thinking to programming, engineering, and design, all of which
    are lifelong skills for the STEM-focused future. \n\nThis project combines wireless
    communication, tablets, and embedded microcontroller technologies to converge
    on an interactive system for specifying the behavior of a responsive, environmental-sensing
    robot and to then lock the resulting behavior onboard the microcontroller, creating
    a programmable, responsive robot system for education at the lowest cost possible.
    Robot-to-robot communication is effected using mesh networking, enabling sensor
    sharing and synchronization of action across robots in a classroom. A newly designed
    drag-and-drop programming interface on the tablet screen demonstrates the basic
    concepts of feedback control systems and directly programs the embedded microprocessor.
    Uploading of the feedback control system specification directly to the microprocessor,
    in turn, enables autonomous operation of the robot without the need for a dedicated
    programming tablet at all times. This project makes use of participatory design,
    interaction design, hardware architecture, firmware programming, and supply chain
    analysis to arrive at a usable system that can be produced in large quantities
    as appropriate for national and international demand. The participatory design
    portion of this work will include direct, collaborative pilots deployed in local
    schools; professional development opportunities for participating teachers; and
    formative evaluations of hands-on robotic activities, with prototypes, in classrooms.

    This project will develop a platform that leverages Colytix? existing app and user base to create a transformative technology capable of addressing the massive gap in student retention among community college and part-time students.  College education is seen as one of the primary drivers of economic success for US citizens and therefore directly impacts on the welfare of citizens and the health of the overall economy.  Community colleges received significant attention in 2015 after President Barack Obama proposed to make community college tuition free to many residents of the US in his State of the Union Address. Once implemented, this plan would increase enrollment at community colleges dramatically, but would likely only exacerbate current poor graduation and retention rates if no changes to the status quo are implemented.  This project will provide a key technology to help to realize these goals across the country.

    An innovative combination of technology, interaction design, and educational theory will be used to enable collaboration between students as well as their faculty and mentors. The ultimate goal of the project is to create an individualized platform that breaks each student?s long term goals down into manageable, short term, individualized targets while providing a community of other students and faculty to monitor progress, provide encouragement, and provide timely and appropriate interventions when necessary. This approach will address all of the key factors in low student retention and provide a clear pathway to success for each individual student. The initial focus of the project will be on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in community colleges, but the underlying principles of the platform can be applied to any discipline across any geography and/or institution.

    to develop a handheld, one-step paper-based device for rapid self-testing of sexually
    transmitted infections. The company aims to replace lab-based assays for Chlamydia
    trachomatis (CT) and expand testing access to previously unreachable settings.
    The technology combines the ease-of-use and very low cost of rapid point-of-care
    (POC) diagnostics with the high accuracy of lab-based tests, enabling unprecedented
    reliability at the POC and at home. CT infection is one of the most prevalent
    STIs in the US. An estimated three million new cases occur each year with direct
    annual medical costs of greater than $3.5 billion. Untreated CT, symptomatic or
    not, may cause long term pregnancy complications, even infertility. Traditional
    lab-based CT assays prevent the ability to test-and-treat within one patient visit.
    This delay results in a high number of cases that do not get treatment due to
    loss-to-follow up (especially for young STI patients) and increased infection
    transmission. Phase Diagnostics? novel device will be: (1) Fast: Results to the
    patient in less than 15 minutes; (2) Affordable: Costs less than $1 to manufacture;
    (3) Accurate: Sensitivity and specificity on par with lab-based assays; (4) Convenient:
    Handheld with no required equipment or training. \n\nThe key innovation of the
    company's novel device is to use aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) to selectively
    pre-concentrate the pathogenic bacteria prior to detection, thereby dramatically
    enhancing the accuracy of conventional rapid LFA POC technology and enabling the
    use of urine samples for the detection of CT. During Phase I, the company was
    able to adapt ATPS to urine medium, attain improved limits of detection of its
    system and make considerable progress in fully integrating all components into
    a true one-step paper microfluidic strip. The objective of Phase II is to fully
    develop the company's proposed device to be ready for FDA 510(k) clearance and
    CLIA waiver enabling clinical studies. The company will first complete the product
    optimization work initiated in Phase I and perform additional device robustness
    studies. As these experiments near completion, the company will work with a contract
    prototyper to design and develop prototypes based on the final optimized device
    components. At the same time, the company will establish small scale manufacturing
    processes to ensure that it can generate a reproducible pilot batch. The company
    will then perform Alpha and Beta product testing to determine the clinical performance
    of its prototype as well as obtain feedback from end-users to determine areas
    for optimization."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be the discovery of new ionization technology for use with mass spectrometry.  This technology will enable lower cost, lower energy use, and reduced user expertise, which may potentially drive mass spectrometry into large and underserved markets such as medical diagnostics and field portable instruments designed specifically for use in homeland security, bedside diagnostics, or bio-threat detection. The new technology changes the current understanding of ionization processes used in mass spectrometry and provides opportunities for new innovations to advance science through improved measurements, impacting fields such as health, safety, and security. The aims of this Phase II project are to develop interfaces to incorporate the platform developed in Phase I on most major mass spectrometer manufacturer's instruments and to develop technologies for rapid automate analyses even of surfaces.  The research of Phase II is aimed to better understand the fundamentals of this new technology in order to drive commercial success in high sensitivity rapid analyses at a competitive price. Mass spectrometers are widely used representing a $4 billion industry of which ionization technology represents a significant commercial opportunity.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to revolutionize ionization in mass spectrometry by providing commercial products that utilize a simple and powerful ionization technology. The newly discovered process spontaneously converts large and small, volatile and nonvolatile compounds to the gas-phase ions necessary for analysis using mass spectrometry without employing currently used high cost lasers or high voltage. The method is broadly applicable for analysis of compounds such as drugs, lipids, carbohydrate conjugates, peptides, and proteins directly from bodily fluids or tissue, as well as synthetic polymers and inorganic catalytic surfaces.  This technology is anticipated to augment or even replace older ionization methods in applications such as clinical analyses, pharmaceuticals, forensics, environmental, and food safety. The aims of the Phase II project are to implement the multifunctional platform developed during Phase I on a variety of manufacturer's instruments, automate the process to allow lower cost and faster analyses, and provide an automated surface analysis platform.  Besides determining the best sample preparation methodologies and choice of solvents/matrices, the research objectives include innovative automated sample introduction technologies that eliminate the need for a conventional "ion source" while reducing the pumping requirements, which currently hinder development of small, low-cost portable mass spectrometers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate a prototype of a
    high-throughput, agile, low-cost manufacturing system for tile mosaics. Mosaics have been a source of
    visual splendor for millennia, but they have always required arduous and painstaking hand assembly.
    Our Phase I proved the feasibility of a programmable, high-throughput robotic tile-assembly system to
    enhance the production of mosaic tilings. Phase II R&D will build upon Phase I success to further speed
    up, automate and scale the system, develop an effective agile manufacturing management system, and
    analyze the economic viability of robotic mosaic assembly for Phase III. We will accomplish this by
    enhancing the mechanical processes and reducing operator time - in addition to developing a productionflow
    information system. After Phase II system optimization, we will evaluate the commercial potential
    of the Artaic technology. The anticipated technical result will be providing a 5x faster manufacturing
    process with a 75% reduction in the price per square foot of customizable mosaic tilings produced. The
    intellectual merits of this SBIR project involve Artaic?s disruptive robotic technology, which transforms
    mosaic installation from its current, time-consuming manual labor processes to a rapid, robotically
    directed customizable process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project expands the utilization of artisanal mosaic work
    while increasing the competitive advantage of U.S. manufacturing processes through increased
    automation and customization. Successful development of this technology will enable a breakthrough
    pricing structure that is 75% lower than the competition (based on manual and rudimentary automated
    processes), leading to broad market affordability and widespread commercial adoption. Our robotic
    system has the potential to revolutionize the $76B global tile industry, while creating numerous
    domestic job opportunities. Artaic expects that the 5x increase in manufacturing speed realized during
    Phase I will be maintained in Phase II during manufacturing scale-up without loss of placement
    accuracy. The increased understanding of robotic agile manufacturing-enabled mass customization
    processes will expand the scientific understanding of related robotic processes that utilize highthroughput
    flexible assemblies, such as for medical or pharmaceutical technologies, or for consumer
    products. In addition, classical mosaic techniques will become more accessible as an art form to all
    students, while undergraduate students will increase their understanding of STEM concepts through
    engineering courses utilizing this technology. Artists and designers will find the realization of their
    design work much more practical and affordable as a business enterprise.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates the feasibility of constructing vivid, full-color, reflective display modules for large-area outdoor digital signage driven by dielectric elastomers suitable for pilot testing.  Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.

    In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project is to commercialize Pyrochem Catalyst Company's (PCC)
    catalyst materials.   These catalyst materials are unique in that the catalytically
    active metal is atomically dispersed in a rigid crystalline matrix.  This imparts
    unparalleled thermal stability, even at temperatures in excess of 1000°C.  Conventional
    catalysts typically require much higher precious metal loadings (as much as 20
    times) to achieve the same activity as the materials developed in this project
    and at high temperatures those active metals can agglomerate into large clusters
    reducing their performance and the lifetime of the catalyst.  The series of catalysts
    developed in this project are designed in a way that all precious metal is optimally
    utilized and protected.  This includes resistance from sulfur poisoning and the
    accumulation of carbon when operating under severe conditions.  This makes these
    materials ideal for high temperature processes such as steam methane reforming
    for hydrogen generation, autothermal reforming for syngas production, syngas generation
    in oxygen transport membranes (OTM), and exhaust oxidation in automotive catalytic
    convertors.     \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II STTR program are to build
    on the success of the Phase I objectives that developed a low cost and continuous
    catalyst manufacturing method for producing the pyrochlore powders that are the
    basis for the proposed catalyst product.  The method may be equally effective
    for producing other types of mixed metal oxides like perovskites and fluorites.
    In Phase II, PCC will construct and test a scaled-up production platform, following
    the design elements of the proof of concept demonstrated in Phase I.  The new
    unit will be designed to manufacture proprietary pyrochlore powders at a rate
    with a hundred-fold increase over production rates of the Phase I unit.  The Phase
    II technical efforts also examine a range of catalyst synthesis parameters like
    oxidant gas concentration/composition, temperature distribution in the production
    unit, precursor residence times, synthesis solution chemistry, and optimizing
    heat and mass transport.  Through a subaward, powders produced from the process
    will be characterized and tested for activity by the National Energy Technology
    Labs, Morgantown, WV.  The overall goal of this project is the development of
    a high throughput / high yield manufacturing process that produces high performance
    catalysts for commercial sale."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project presents novel technology to fabricate dry, removable, reusable adhesives based on aligned polymeric nanofibers using scalable electrospinning methodologies.  This new approach offers the potential advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using nozzle-free nanofiber spinning processes. Dry reusable adhesives as a replacement for messy liquid glues will improve product safety and reduce environmental impact. Removable and reusable adhesive tapes and labels will also eliminate waste and facilitate product recycling. The resulting products will have strong shear adhesion and easy peel, leading to broad application with a wide range of substrates like glass, metal, wall board, and plastics. Proof-of-concept samples have confirmed market-driven value propositions. The Phase II project will develop commercial products and applications for consumer and industrial applications, for automotive assembly systems, for decorative wall murals, and for medical device and health care uses. Fiber spinning and collection techniques will be engineered to improve product performance, reduce costs and improve scalability of the manufacturing process.

    The Phase I project has confirmed proof-of-concept dry adhesive samples with shear adhesion strengths exceeding 20 N/cm2 in dynamic mode and 45 N/cm2 in dead weight mode.  The resulting samples have low peel strength and are reusable. In Phase II, the electrospinning process will be optimized using novel polymer blend systems to achieve performance targets for specific customer product development. The nozzleless electrospinning process will be scaled to the pilot level for product testing and to provide the engineering design basis for commercial manufacture. A continuous roll-to-roll process to produce aligned nanofibers will break new ground in the electrospinning industry.  New applications in medical devices have been proposed by strategic partners to capitalize on the self-adhesion properties of these materials.  Dry adhesive applicator systems will be developed to allow the aligned adhesive nanofibers to conform to surface asperities. With the Phase I success of proof-of-concept prototypes, the Phase II effort will move the development of aligned nanofiber dry adhesives into the market introduction phase in preparation for commercial manufacture and sales.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes
    to develop a faster and more accurate optical instrument for studying live cells
    and tissues. The study of live cells has yielded numerous discoveries (e.g. germ
    theory, the Krebs cycle, cell division) and is important for drug discovery and
    disease treatment. Live cells are transparent and need to be observed for long
    periods of time (days, weeks) in their natural state. To make the cells visible
    and measure them quantitatively, current state of the art instruments require
    injecting the cells with staining agents or light emitting fluorophores. Both
    processes are invasive, labor intensive and expensive and long term observations
    of live cells is difficult: staining embalms the cells and the fluorophores fade
    quickly and kill the cells in hours. The Phase I project produced a proof-of-concept
    prototype that provides quantitative imaging of live cells by processing the light
    transmitted through the cells in their natural state. Completion of the Phase
    II objectives will upgrade the Phase I prototype to a commercial grade instrument:
    improve optical design and build a housing enclosure, develop commercial grade
    software and automate the hardware controls and develop task-specific software
    applications to solve particular biological problems. \n\t\n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is to enable life scientists with a new and powerful
    instrument for studying live cells. The greatest impact of the commercial instrument
    developed in Phase II project will have is enabling researchers to do science
    better than before, i.e., more accurately, more quantitatively, and more noninvasively.
    The range of breakthroughs enabled by the instrument will likely include: novel
    drug discovery by accurate monitoring of cell response to treatment, fundamental
    studies of cell proliferation and growth, minimally invasive automatic diagnosis
    of cancer biopsies, and fast and accurate blood testing instruments. Scaling up
    the production of the instrument will create new jobs and increase the US dominance
    in the biotechnology area. Due to their full automation, the instruments can also
    operate in areas with limited access to trained personnel and provide the digital
    data necessary for remote diagnosis, such as Medically Underserved Areas/Populations
    in United States."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project comes from addressing the thermal challenges brought about by the significant increase in transistor density that semiconductors have experienced over the past few decades. This trend has enabled many advancements ranging from high performance servers to Internet of Things devices. Still, with every advance in chip technology, the difficulty of chip cooling continues to increase. Three major thermal interface material (TIM) market segments exist: polymer composites, metallic materials and phase-change materials. Commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will create a fourth market segment that will supplant existing TIMs, initially in the chip testing market and eventually extending into servers, high performance computing and Internet of Things devices. CNT researchers and small businesses have made little progress towards a commercial TIM product. Among other factors, this failure is driven by poor positioning in the crowded low-cost TIM space, which is currently dominated by thermal greases and pads. Progress towards a viable solution lies in the strategic alignment of product features with industry pain points. This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a means to scale the ability to produce CNT based TIMs as well as to further improve their performance.

    The technical objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are to: 1) scale up of the CNT TIM manufacturing process to achieve a production capacity of 200,000 sq. in of product annually and to 2) enhance the conductivity of the CNT array by a factor of 3x or more to facilitate entry into the TIM1 and TIM2 market. This project will ultimately develop processes that will translate into achieving production scale CNT based thermal interface materials for the first time in the world. Scale up will be achieved through a combination of physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition processes developed on tools designed specifically for CNT production. In Phase I of this research effort, two commercial products aimed at the semiconductor chip testing market were developed and validated through collaboration with leading chip manufacturers. In addition to the chip testing market segment, in Phase II products will be developed for entry into the TIM1 and Internet of Things markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project will be the enhanced ability to monitor NOx optically using a unique approach that is fundamentally different from voltage biased solid electrolyte diffusion technology deployed commercially today. NSF Phase I activities brought to light the shortcomings of existing sensor technology, including slow response time and up to 90% "garbage data" that OEMs and regulatory authorities have to work around. Phase II efforts include improvement of Phase I prototypes where near instantaneous NOx detection to ~200 ppm was observed. NOx are a major pollutant and precursor to acid rain, surface ozone and smog formation. Worldwide regulatory bodies are driving NOx regulations to increasingly stringent levels, thus presenting even greater challenges for real-world emissions. Addressing these regulations, industry must deploy after-treatment technologies including selective catalyst reduction systems and lean NOx traps. Both of these technologies will benefit from a less expensive, more robust, and faster responding NOx sensor. With continued success, the new NOx sensor has the potential to significantly reduce emissions levels through a more accurate and much faster detection than current NOx detection techniques thus allowing the internal combustion engine to directly employ detection feedback to enhance emission controls.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the prototyping and characterization of an optical based Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) sensor technology not based on oxygen sensor derivatives found in the market today. We will further optimize the design and materials needed for a novel thermo-catalytic NOx sensing mechanism through continued experimentation and testing. Increasing the number and type of catalytic sensing elements and integrating them into existing OEM packaging will allow us to measure NOx as well as other gases including ammonia (NH3). Sensor calibration equations and response lookup-tables will help validate our new method for NOx detection with successful results creating the foundation of a new category of sensors based on this differential detection architecture. Current automotive NOx sensors do not meet response time, accuracy and price requirements as used in the industry where such parameters are critical. The Phase II will optimize the optical sensing mechanism, and planned designs of experiment will help refine this technology into a reliable and robust device. Besides NOx and NH3, our "inorganic taste buds" also derive carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon concentration as a byproduct of the measurement process, thus providing additional utility for any combustion emissions control application.

    develop a technology to transform swine manure into sustainable alternatives for
    petroleum-based adhesives, with a first opportunity in the asphalt market.  This
    project builds on a successful Phase I effort as well as a prior Innovation Corps
    award. The major socio-economic impact of the technology will be in rural areas,
    as it will allow pig farmers to alleviate the burden of manure management and
    create a new revenue stream.  This project also offers a novel approach to develop
    low-cost, durable, and eco-friendly construction adhesives, reduce the cost associated
    with manure management and lagoon maintenance, create new manufacturing and engineering
    jobs, and reduce our dependence on petroleum resources. Current practices for
    handling manure release carbon to the atmosphere, either from manure storage or
    anaerobic digestion of manure. In contrast, the proposed technology sequesters
    carbon in bio-adhesives, while passing nutrients to the effluents, bio-char, and
    grey water, which can then be used as fertilizer.  The Phase I research results
    have shown that bio-adhesive is more durable, lower in cost ($0.50/gallon, as
    compared with $2.00/gallon) and more eco-friendly (lower volatile organic compound
    levels) than many petroleum-based adhesives.\n \nThe core technology to be developed
    further in this effort uses thermochemical liquefaction to convert swine manure
    to bio-oil, followed by the polymerization of bio-oil to produce bio-adhesives.
    This technology will eventually enable use of the six billion gallons of swine
    manure that are generated annually in the U.S. to supply about 88 million barrels
    of bio-adhesive.  As a result of the Phase I effort, a study of the effects of
    heating rate on the yield and quality of bio-adhesive was completed; this in turn,
    helped ensure that the conversion process takes place successfully, thereby addressing
    one of the main scale-up challenges. The resulting data were used as an input
    for the design of a pilot bio-reactor, including central heaters and a heat exchanger.
    \ After the design phase, the team began the fabrication and assembly of this
    bio-reactor, and followed up with multiple trials.  In the Phase II project, building
    on these successful trials, we will complete the troubleshooting of the bio-reactor
    while finalizing the design and construction of the oil separation and polymerization
    column, and sampling valves.  These items will permit a fully-realized pilot plant
    by the end of this project."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will reduce energy consumption in buildings and automobiles via 'smart' solar control window films. The effects of solar heating are frequently experienced on sunny warm days when the inside temperature of a car can exceed 130°F in minutes. The same solar heating that is such a nuisance in summer is very much desired in winter. The national problem is that buildings consume more than 41% of all energy produced (more than 50% directly for heating, cooling, and lighting) which leads to an estimated 2,236M metric tons of greenhouse gases. Additionally, 80% of buildings that exist today will exist in 20 years, many of which are inefficient and outdated. This necessitates a retrofittable smart solar control film. The consequence of installing smart solar control film is that the sun's warmth can be harnessed when it is needed and reflected away when it is unneeded. Installing these highly transparent films will have significant energy savings in space heating, cooling, and lighting. If smart solar control films are implemented, the Department of Energy estimates as much as 1.0 quadrillion BTUs ($10B in cost savings) can be saved annually.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on commercializing a family of doped nanoceramic materials that exhibit near-room temperature metal-to-insulator phase transitions. Slight changes to the composition of matter produce remarkably tunable thermochromic transitions over a broad range of temperatures, filling a key technological gap for their deployment as a smart solar control window film. No visible change occurs during the transition from the low-temperature/infrared transparent (insulating-like phase) to the high-temperature/infrared reflective (metal-like phase), and vice versa. The nanomaterials are also of sufficient stability, optical clarity, and compatible with commonly used polymers found in film. Phase II efforts address optimizing the composition of matter for peak performance and developing a unique in-line nanomanufacturing process compatible with scalable production and achieving more precise control. In order for these materials to perform correctly they need to be of the correct elemental composition and be in the form of nanoparticles of the correct size. The films will be optimized and then thoroughly tested in the laboratory and in the field for their performance, stability, optical clarity, and a wide variety of application-specific performance requirements.

    specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish, and livestock,
    as well as food for human consumption.  Moreover, microalgae can be used as a
    feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from the environment.
    \  However, for the nascent algae cultivation industry to achieve its full commercial
    potential, the technology must be improved.  While typical algal cultivation relies
    on high-density cell growth, this project will focus on the science of low-density
    algal cultivation to achieve high productivity, while minimizing process requirements
    for supplemental energy and concentrated CO2.  In addition, the development of
    a closed-system photo-bioreactor with emphasis on low cost and modular design
    will allow the process to be easily replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to de-risk the volume manufacturability and reliability of thin crystalline power MOSFETs fabricated with a novel exfoliation technology demonstrated in Phase 1.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable lower cost and better performance for power devices in switching or transferring electricity under varying power requirements across the voltage spectrum in a variety of applications ranging from consumer, to communications, automotive and industrial applications.  In all of these applications, the ON resistance of the power MOSFET and IGBTs can be reduced and the switching speed and performance further improved by reducing the device thickness.  Additionally, in consumer and mobile applications, reducing the form factor of the power MOSFET devices can enable slimmer and lighter products.  A significant broader impact of this technology will be the reduction of expensive and environmentally hazardous waste treatment processes associated with wafer grinding technology used in the power MOSFET industry.  While the power MOSFETs developed using this technology can have broad commercial and societal impact, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS and passive devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of Power MOSFETs which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over the next decade with favorable cost structures.  During phase I, functional power MOSFETs were demonstrated with this thin crystalline technology to establish the feasibility of this technology for power devices. This phase II effort will focus on the following specific technical challenges to bring it to market. (1) Develop power MOSFETs with improved switching characteristics using the thin crystalline technology (2) High voltage high current characterization of the thin crystalline power MOSFETs (3) Process yield and reliability characterization of package thin crystalline power MOSFET parts and (4) Convert existing process line to use thin crystalline exfoliation technology in high volume manufacturing flow.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a platform to rapidly design synthetic
    organisms to produce biochemicals, which will replace environmentally harmful,
    ecologically inefficient industrial chemical processes. The technology developed
    in this proposal will provide a competitive edge in the rapid engineering of synthetic
    organisms to produce biochemicals by fermentation that are currently produced
    from oil (reducing our CO2 emissions) or extracted from natural species (reducing
    our taxing load on existing ecosystems). This technology also has the potential
    to be used for the manufacture of drugs, and to engineer novel organisms to improve
    crop production and therefore help address the mounting challenges of providing
    food to a growing world population without tapping too much in Earth's resources.
    Commercially, the chemicals that will be enabled by application of the technology
    developed during the Phase I program open up billion dollar markets that are currently
    inaccessible to the chemical industry. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes
    to develop a platform that combines computational enzyme design with systems biology
    to create a fully integrated system for the design and testing of novel cell factories
    for the production of bulk and fine chemicals. During the Phase I project, the
    company, in collaboration with the University of Washington, has successfully
    developed a high-performance software code to rapidly design novel metabolic pathways
    to produce any target chemical from central metabolism. In Phase II, the company
    will further advance the concept by (1) developing a high-performance pathway
    prioritization module to estimate each designed pathway yield and impact on organism
    metabolism in the context of whole-genome models and (2) use the software platform
    to design libraries of pathways for the production of a variety of specialty chemical
    targets that are commercially valuable and not known to be produced by fermentation
    at scale. Then, (3) using an experimental screening setup, the DNA for all the
    proposed pathways will be assembled screened at high-throughput for detectable
    production of the target chemicals."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve light/heat control into the automobile and enhance user comfort by replacing existing automotive glass with dynamic automotive glass.  Economic and environmental benefits of using dynamic windows in automobiles include increase of miles per gallon by reducing air conditioning load with enhance light/heat management.  Replacing standard automotive sunroof glass with dynamic sunroof glass will increase fuel efficiency by 3 miles per gallon during summer time.  If all the glass in an automobile is replaced with dynamic glass then the impact will be much larger, resulting in decrease in oil consumption by several millions of barrels per day.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will utilize scalable solution processed techniques to create unique fast switching electrochromic layers. Current dynamic window technologies have not reached their market potential due to their high cost.  Due to technological limitations, current dynamic window products can only be used for sunroof applications as a result there are not being used for side windows, rear glass or windshield.  New class of electrochromic windows based on innovative materials and device designs that achieve fast switching, high contrast and low production costs will enable wide spread adoption of smart windows in a broad range of automobiles. The novel electrochromic layers developed during Phase I research will be improved further and scaled up to commercially significant size prototypes. New smart windows will cost 3-4x lower compared to current smart window products on the market or in advanced development stage.  These novel electrochromic devices will be thoroughly characterized and their long term reliability established by the end of Phase II research. At the end of Phase II prototypes of fast switching electrochromic automotive glazing will be built that are suitable for installation in a car for sunroof and/or side window.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project plans to develop an affordable device that will allow the visually handicapped community to access digital information in a robust format comparable to a mobile tablet computer. Current embodiments of this technology use 40 year old technology that cannot scale beyond two lines of text, consume significant amounts of power, and are prohibitively expensive when using more than a single line. This Phase II project will focus on establishing a mechanical Braille cell module using the polymer-based single dot actuator successfully developed in the Phase I project as the foundation for a multiline display. The primary technical challenges to be addressed are achieving the mechanistic and electrical requirements while maintaining low production costs. Thus, this project has three primary objectives that build on the single-dot actuator: (a) construction and testing of 1- and 6-dot prototypes that meet technical requirements, (b) construction of an 8-dot Braille cell and demonstration electronics and software, and (c) assembly of a short line of Braille text to demonstrate the cells perform as expected when arrayed in the anticipated display format. Additionally, PBI has the access to technical facilities and knowledge to successfully perform the Phase II.


    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the visually handicapped community, 1.3-2 Million individuals, does not have access to an affordable device comparable to a modern a mobile tablet or computer display. This severely limits the ability of this community to access digital information and dramatically impacts literacy levels, STEM-related education, and employment. The currently available piezo-electric technology is prohibitively expensive and cannot display more than 2 lines at once. This makes it unsuitable for use with mathematical equations, images, and other larger-scale digital information. The affordable device developed using this Phase II funding will use a novel polymer technology to display several lines of Braille text at once. In addition to allowing the visually handicapped community to participate more fully in this digital age, the development of this device will change the way complex, multi-line information is disseminated. Braille literature is significantly larger than traditional. For example, the King James Bible weighs 64lbs, takes up 60 inches of shelf space 12 inches x 12 inches and costs $342. This technology is expected to impact multiple industries such as call centers, libraries, digital content providers, STEM, business, print media, and anywhere modern users benefit from digital content.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on a novel ultrasonic acoustophoretic separation technology that is economic, efficient, sustainable, and environmentally benign.  Current technologies, e.g., hydrocyclones, and membrane filtration, suffer from problems, such as high energy costs, use of consumables, fouling, and limited efficiency in separation of micron-sized particles.  The proposed technology does not generate waste, does not use consumables, operates at a low energy cost, and provides efficient separation for micron-size particles.  Ultrasonic standing waves are used to trap secondary phase particles in a fluid stream, when the acoustic radiation force exerted on the particles is stronger than the combined effect of fluid drag and buoyancy.  The action of the acoustic forces on the trapped particles results in agglomeration and/or coalescence of particles and droplets.  Heavier than water particles are separated through enhanced gravitational settling, and lighter particles through enhanced buoyancy.  During Phase I, successful prototypes were designed with a separation efficiency of more than 90% of a 1000 ppm emulsion at flow rates of 2500 Liters per minute.  Phase II focuses on the development of a system capable of processing 4 gpm, with fully integrated customized electronics, and testing of the system on real-world emulsions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the novel acoustophoretic separation technology provides for a cheaper and lower cost of energy separation of multi- component phase mixtures.  It can function as a drop-in replacement for conventional separation technology, such as hydrocyclones and other methods.   The societal impact is the development of separation technologies that are sustainable and environmentally benign since they do not generate any waste or use consumables.  Enhanced extraction of micron-sized oil droplets from water offer opportunities for enhanced oil recovery and oil-spill cleanup and reduce the emission of micron-sized oil droplets into the environment. This project increases the science and technology behind the use of acoustic radiation force on large volume flow rate. Full numerical models will be created to use in conjunction with experimental results. Dissemination of this work will be done by publishing our results in peer reviewed journals and conferences.  This project provides several internships to undergraduate engineering students, an opportunity to learn and practice engineering, innovation, and entrepreneurship at a small start-up company.  FloDesign Sonics has a strong history and commitment to integrating undergraduate students in the development of their technology through offering internships and providing supervision for senior capstone design projects.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a computer-aided mosaic
    design and robotic assembly system for automation of a centuries-old manual process. Despite their
    prominence in art and architecture, mosaics are arduous to design and assemble. Labor-intensive
    methods have stubbornly resisted automation, adding considerable cost and delay to projects. Artaic's
    Phase I research proved feasibility of computer-aided design software to create renderings and digital
    blueprints of artisanal mosaics by introducing a streamlined, procedural workflow for tile layout that
    closely mimicked the workflow of mosaic artists, and did so over 10x faster than manual methods. The
    goal of the Phase II research is to demonstrate the speed, effectiveness, utility, and artistic quality of this mosaic design and robotic assembly system. The key Phase II objectives are to: (1) demonstrate a
    prototype artisanal mosaic design system and; (2) demonstrate a robotic mosaic production system, that
    will be: (3) validated for accuracy, speed, and quality through user assessment, and; (4) evaluated for
    economic and commercial potential. Anticipated technical results will enable a revolutionary
    advancement from manual to automated processes in mosaic design and production, comparable to the
    displacement of film by digital camera technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in art, design, construction, and
    architecture. Software and robotic automation will lower the cost of mosaics and increase its traditional
    societal impact of adorning public, commercial, and residential spaces. Artists, designers, and builders
    will have a significantly faster method to produce artisanal mosaics without the high cost and
    time associated with manual design and production. The efficiencies made possible by this proposed
    computer-aided mosaic design and manufacturing system will enable Artaic to expand into the global
    multi-billion dollar tile market and develop a domestic workforce to compete against global
    manufacturers of handcrafted mosaic artwork. Additionally, the computational demands of the rendering
    algorithms developed during Phase II will give impetus to further development of advanced GPUs and
    CPUs -- with companies such as Intel, Nvidia, and AMD providing solutions for increasingly more
    advanced rendering algorithms. Perhaps the most significant societal benefit from the development of
    this technology is its potential to make artisanal mosaic design and production accessible and affordable
    to the general public, and because this research enables any Photoshop artist to become a mosaic artist, it
    also hold significant promise as an educational tool in our nation's schools.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will continue development of a non-resorbable surgical film which prevents internal tissue-attachment. The proposed device will improve post-surgical outcomes from patients who suffer from internal tissue-attachment triggered by cardiothoracic or neurological surgery. Patients who undergo surgery are at risk for developing unwanted tissue-attachment due to trauma as a result of surgical intervention. This tissue-attachment can lead to severe complications and increase the burden of post-operative care resulting additional expenditures through extended hospital stays, readmissions, and increased morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, undesirable tissue attachment can obstruct the surgical field upon re-operation when necessary. Surgical related tissue-attachment is a problem amongst many surgical procedures in a number of areas. However, cardiothoracic and neurological procedures are often more complicated than gastrointestinal or gynecologic procedures, making any complications more expensive and risky to providers, payers and patients. Additionally, re-operations in cardiac or neuro-spine cases are extremely difficult, which underscore the need for an effective solutions to prevent this malady even more urgent. A product that can effectively prevent undesirable tissue-attachment and provide the surgeon with a clear surgical field and plane of view would be highly desirable in both cardio-thoracic and neurological surgery.

    The proposed project will conduct additional pre-clinical work leading to a regulatory submission for a cardio-thoracic indication and additional validation within the neurological field. Positive animal studies completed during Phase I & IB efforts revealed the capacity of the Sintact Film? to reduce tissue attachment and provide for a clear field of view upon re-entry or re-operation. Initial Phase II work will examine the feasibility of scaling-up certain manufacturing and production processes resulting in a clinical grade product which will undergo sterility, safety, animal, biocompatibility, and mechanical testing. This testing will be compared directly to a predicate or equivalent approved medical device. Results will need to show equivalency of the Sintact Film? to the predicate device across all testing metrics. Additional Phase II work will enable further validation of the Sintact Film? for neurological indications. A larger definitive neurological study will be completed to address the capability of the Sintact Film? to be deployed effectively in a neurological setting. Positive results from this study will provide a basis for pursuing expanded indications and additional market opportunities. If successful the implications that a non-resorbable product can be an effective countermeasure in these areas would alter the current methodology in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to combat modern day slavery in the United States and Canada. In this project the company will go beyond the public sector, selling its capabilities to the hospitality industry, which shares a role in tackling this problem. Banks also play a part in detecting financial transactions which stem from criminal revenue streams. These new markets expand the revenue opportunity and social impact of the technology. The proposed Phase II research and development will solve huge challenges voiced by the company's law enforcement users. The deployment of these research products through a platform that enables evidence management and collaboration will accelerate the impact by increasing communication among the fragmented law enforcement jurisdictions in the United States. This will enable agencies to conduct more effective investigations, and empower them to take on larger cases involving organized crime across state lines. Finally, human expertise will be developed within the company and through its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University to commercialize advanced computing research for real-world, social impact. These innovations will empower more victim rescues and exploiter prosecutions. The project will create a culture within the company to nurture engineers in social entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will expand on machine learning technology created in Phase I to deobfuscate escort ads and implement end-to-end innovations for investigations. Each day, there are thousands of online data points related to prostitution. Hidden behind this content are victims of sex trafficking, those forced or coerced into sex work, including juveniles who have not reached the age of consent. Big Data presents the opportunity to seize this information to disrupt traffickers and organized groups who drive the cycle of exploitation. The company's research objectives include maximizing evidence recall using sophisticated crawlers and deobfuscation methods, as well as generating leads using natural language processing and multi-modal machine learning. The project will further develop computer vision capabilities to interpret features of an image and enable visual search for missing victims. It will formalize methods for collecting ground truth, preventing false positives, and diagnosing algorithmic performance relevant to users' needs. Finally, the company will deploy this research into accessible software products that provide real-time, digestible, and actionable information to law enforcement, resulting in the rescue of hundreds, or potentially thousands, of sex trafficking victims.

    develop copper based pastes for the metallization of silicon solar cells. Photovoltaics
    (PV) offer an opportunity for clean and affordable energy and over the past decade
    the PV industry has seen annual compound growth rates of over 50%. Although revenues
    are high, the profit margins for many manufacturers have substantially diminished,
    necessitating the need for cutbacks throughout the value chain. One area marked
    for cost reduction, is in the metallization of the solar cells, which now commands
    nearly 10 percent of the world's supply. Having the cost of photovoltaic panels
    tied to a precious metal with price volatility can lead to higher prices for renewable
    energy; thus replacing silver with copper is a significant opportunity for the
    industry. Thus the outcomes of this project would be a product for making solar
    energy more affordable. The project also includes creating two new full time positions
    in Kentucky in Advanced Research and Manufacturing. This proposal will enhance
    scientific understanding of the copper-silicon contact formation and durability
    of the material during operation. \n\nThe technological feasibility of the copper
    pastes with an inherent diffusion barrier was demonstrated on standard and bifacial
    solar cells in Phase I. Phase II will further improve the screen printable pastes
    to industry standards. To achieve the high electrical performance required in
    this market, the project will investigate the copper-silicon interface to investigate
    the mechanisms involved during contact formation, and the chemical nature of the
    copper-silicon interface. This information will be used to optimize the chemical
    composition and thermal treatment of the pastes to improve electrical performance
    and cell lifetime. The pastes will be optimized for industrial operating equipment
    to provide the manufacturer with a product that can be dropped in, with minimal
    changes to the production line. Phase II will also involve scale up of the core
    materials in the pastes to be able to engage customers in further printing trials.
    Through the assembly and testing of prototype solar cell modules, the durability
    of the copper contacts will be demonstrated. The outcomes of this proposal will
    be screen printable copper pastes that can be direct drop in replacement for the
    silver pastes; thereby enhancing the profit margins of the solar cell manufacturer."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is far-reaching in terms of improving the quality
    of life and the cost/efficacy of healthcare for more than 20 Million people in
    the USA. We address the need for better methods for identifying and guiding the
    treatment of ambulatory patients with dangerous heart dysfunctions such as intermittent
    arrhythmias and heart failure. For example, atrial fibrillation arrhythmia afflicts
    nearly 8 Million patients in the USA, approximately 460,000 new patients every
    year, and the patient load is projected to grow to 12.1 million by 2050. The disease
    and its complications (stroke, congestive heart failure, seizures, death, etc.)
    add $26B to the nation's annual healthcare costs. Heart Failure currently afflicts
    nearly 5.7 Million people in the US growing to 8 Million by 2030. Their treatment
    and frequent hospitalization costs are already at 14B$ and will grow to 29B$ by
    2030.  Together with reducing the economic impacts, it would be of an enormous
    benefit to human health to create a device that improves the diagnosis and guides
    effective therapy for these patients while they remain fully ambulatory and going
    about their normal activities outside the expensive confines of the hospital.\n
    \ \n\nThe proposed project has the following intellectual merits. In our Phase
    I STTR program we focused on developing a wearable Atrial Fibrillation monitor
    to assist physicians in the diagnosis of paroxysmal or episodic versions of that
    disorder. In Phase II we have pivoted towards the even more critical need of ambulatory
    monitoring of paroxysmal tachycardia and eventually heart failure patients. The
    current industry standard of ambulatory ECG does not provide enough sensitivity
    or specificity to determine if the patient has atypical or typical atrial flutter,
    paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia as well as various forms of ventricular
    tachycardia. Accurately diagnosing and monitoring these disorders is critical
    to patient treatment and outcomes. Our device will be capable of ambulatory patient
    monitoring for any sort of arrhythmia, and we believe it can be the preferred
    choice for all portable monitoring if it provides in one device ECG, heart motion
    and breathing rate/pattern/volume. So, the overarching technical research goal
    of our Phase II work is to develop a full featured prototype cardiac motion sensor
    as described above that can be used for initial clinical tests. These features
    include: wearable, battery powered, signal storage, cardiac motion from radar,
    disposable antenna, onboard ECG, and breathing rate."

    implement a proprietary rare earth extraction process on recycled NdFeB magnets
    at pilot scale to prove commercial production feasibility. By recovering rare
    earth elements (REEs) readily available in waste streams, this effort will help
    create a secondary source of these critical elements, thereby reducing U.S. dependence
    on an unstable, limited supply from China. This will, in turn, lay the groundwork
    necessary for the production of cutting-edge technologies reliant upon these materials
    to return to the U.S.  The Nd and Dy elements which are recovered from this process
    are the critical components that increase the efficiency of electric motors by
    up to 30%. The availability of these resources will also significantly improve
    the vertical integration of manufacturing for national security technologies that
    depend heavily upon REEs, such as guided missile actuators and jet-fighter control
    panels. This project will also impact the electronics recycling sector by creating
    a new, reliable revenue stream for electronics recycling companies.\n \nThe process
    to reclaim REEs from NdFeB magnets is simple and energy-efficient, with a minimal
    environmental footprint. The Phase I SBIR project demonstrated the feasibility
    of developing the process beyond laboratory scale to pilot scale, improved the
    purity of the end product and reduced the amount of waste from processing.  The
    Phase II project will focus on the following objectives: 1) designing a scale
    up strategy and building a pilot scale production plant; 2) optimizing the pilot
    scale production process; 3) maximizing product recovery at pilot scale; 4) designing
    a wastewater treatment and reuse strategy; and 5) minimizing residual contamination
    in the final products.  To achieve these Phase II objectives, we will develop
    process parameters for maximum yield, maximum purity, and minimum processing times
    at pilot scale. The first stage will be to successfully obtain production yields
    of 90+% and purity levels of 99+% in pilot scale batches. For the second stage,
    we will focus on scaling production to prove commercial-scale feasibility, with
    ideal product yields and purities of 95+% and 99+% respectively. Throughout all
    stages, we will focus on understanding and treating the accompanying waste products,
    including wastewater and residual metal impurities."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project is to produce economically the next generation of sustainable, renewable, clean burning, high energy density, transportation biofuels. The proposed technology once successfully developed will enable existing biofuel producers to reduce their costs while increasing the value and diversity of their byproducts. It will convert their industrial waste products into tailored fatty acids suitable for biodiesel. The technology will be compatible with and complementary to cellulosic ethanol producers, and it could potentially double the amount of biodiesel produced in the U.S. today. The 227 domestic ethanol plants range in size from less than 50 to more than 150 million gallons, and they have a total annual capacity of 15 billion gallons. Every gallon of ethanol also yields 1.9 pounds of soluble organics that must be evaporated or disposed. Xylome?s technology has the potential to convert half of this stream into biodiesel and to expand biodiesel production further with cellulosic feedstocks. By converting a larger fraction of the soluble cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars along with fermentation byproducts, Xylome will increase the efficiency of existing ethanol plants and increase biofuel production.

    The objectives of this Phase II research are to increase the rates of production, modification and release of fatty acids from non-conventional lipogenic yeast.  Fatty acids have much higher energy density than ethanol, but similar specific energy yields. Fermentation of organics to lipids can potentially occur with efficiencies equivalent to ethanol production. Lipids normally accumulate under nitrogen limiting conditions after replication has stopped. They are not excreted from the cells so recovery does not require distillation. In Phase I, Xylome scientists identified and over expressed genes that increase lipid accumulation by 1.2- to 2-fold under high nitrogen conditions. In Phase II, they will use mating, selection, screening and evolutionary adaptation to combine the best of these modifications. Xylome scientists have also targeted additional genes to modify and release fatty acids from the cell. Xylome plans to optimize lipid production both from a cellular level with metabolic engineering and from an engineering perspective through bioprocess design and cultivation conditions. Xylome will also engineer cells to use rapidly the complex mixture of soluble oligosaccharides, hemicellulosic sugars and fermentation byproducts. By applying advanced molecular techniques and synthetic biology, Xylome will open up new opportunities for sustainable biofuel production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project is to produce a better natural gas treatment membrane that will allow end users to capture the ease of processing and environmental advantages of membrane technology at a substantially reduced price.  Natural gas processing to remove CO2 and other contaminants is the largest industrial gas separation application with an estimated global separation equipment market of approximately $2-3 billion per year. At present, membrane processes have a 10% market share, while amine absorption processes account for the bulk of the market.  Conventional membrane materials are limited by their relatively modest CO2/CH4 selectivity, which offsets their environmental and efficiency advantages. The novel perfluoro polymer membranes developed in this program show enhanced performance when treating gas mixtures at industrial relevant conditions.  Study of these perfluoro polymer membranes will improve scientific understanding of structure/property relationships for a new family of materials.  Most importantly, applied at a commercial scale, these new perfluoro membranes offer the potential to overcome the limitations of prior membranes, and thereby, transform natural gas processing.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to complete the development of novel perfluoropolymer membranes for use in natural gas CO2 removal. During Phase I, membranes with superior CO2/CH4 separation performance compared to commercial membranes were identified in comparative high-pressure mixture tests. In Phase II, the research and development plan is to scale up production of the most promising perfluoro polymer.  An optimized membrane based on this polymer will be made on a roll-to-roll production line and fabricated into membrane modules. These modules will be evaluated in laboratory parametric experiments and validation tested at an operating natural gas field site.  Results from these tests will be used to update an economic evaluation of the perfluoro membranes compared to conventional technology applied to natural gas CO2 removal.  Completion of these technical objectives will bring this advanced membrane technology to the cusp of commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve wheat yield globally by deploying newly developed, region-specific dwarfing genes. World population is predicted to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050. Wheat demand is expected to increase also due to a shift from rice to wheat consumption due to an expected increase in wealth around the globe. The increased wheat demand will have to be met under less land area and changing climate. Water use efficiency and increase in wheat yields will be important factors in meeting this demand. The proposed technology is poised to increase wheat yield under abiotic stress conditions. All of these benefits are expected to have a major positive impact on humanity.  The wheat seed business is currently valued at up to $8.3 billion. The proposed technology will provide a competitive advantage to capture a significant market share of the wheat seed industry while contributing positively towards food security during the changing climate.

    This SBIR phase II project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Responsible for the "green-revolution," dwarfing genes are required to obtain higher yields, but the two dwarfing genes present in more than 90% of the currently grown wheat varieties have serious ill-effects including abiotic stress sensitivity, reduced root length and biomass, seedling emergence, and vigor. During the Phase I research, four new dwarfing genes were identified and shown to be significantly better than the currently used genes. Phase II will focus on the comparison of the new genes with the old genes to show their true benefits. This research also will generate valuable data required for the development of "release-ready" varieties.  Genetic background effects will be studied by transferring one of the new dwarfing genes into two different backgrounds followed by field and controlled condition evaluation. Future competitive advantage will be maintained by pyramiding the new dwarfing genes with complementary gene action. Closely linked DNA markers will be developed for an efficient transfer of the technology into diverse backgrounds.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is in support of Branch Technology's novel Additive Manufacturing (AM) process that combines 3D printing technology and conventional construction materials to enable a new way to create buildings. The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.

    The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project, in which a non-invasive respiratory muscle stimulation
    device and approach to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation will be developed,
    is a reduction in public health care expenditure and a reduction in morbidity
    for the half a million patients who have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation
    each year in the US. These patients suffer from an array of clinical complications
    (for example, pneumonia) and cost the US health care system $16 billion annually,
    a great deal of which is borne by Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current
    reimbursement landscape economically incentivizes hospitals to wean patients at
    the earliest possible time. The proposed innovation has the potential to positively
    benefit society by providing a solution to this serious healthcare problem. In
    addition, it promises to improve our scientific understanding of respiratory muscle
    physiology and mechanics in difficult to wean patients. It will also improve our
    technical understanding of non-invasive respiratory sensors and biofeedback algorithms
    for the purposes of electrical muscle stimulation. Finally, as demonstrated by
    the number and cost of difficult to wean patients, as well as current healthcare
    reimbursement policies, the proposed innovation has potential to results in a
    considerable commercial impact.  \n \nThe proposed project will develop a non-invasive
    electrical stimulator that automatically applies stimulation to the respiratory
    muscles in synchrony with a patient?s voluntary breathing pattern. This approach
    is expected to address the imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and respiratory
    muscle load - a major factor responsible for weaning difficulty - by assisting
    ventilation during weaning sessions and strengthening the breathing muscles that
    have become weakened as a result of mechanical ventilation. In Phase 1 a functional
    prototype was developed; clinical feasibility of the approach was also demonstrated.
    \ The Phase II proposal focuses on refining the stimulation algorithm to maximize
    its clinical effectiveness and on developing a novel stimulation electrode system
    so that the device can be quickly applied to patients. In addition, methods will
    be developed to interface the technology with a mechanical ventilator to expand
    its clinical application. Finally, a complete works-like, looks-like prototype
    will be developed that is designed to international standards and is safe for
    clinical testing. The work completed in this Phase of the project will enable
    a controlled clinical trial of the proposed approach and ultimately allow the
    device to gain FDA regulatory clearance."

    based on the statistical evidence.  The proposed method of data driven decision
    process for adaptive learning is based on the real- time cross-correlation statistical

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate advancement in high-mobility materials.  These materials are being increasingly used in the electronics device industry.  This project's goal is to enable better devices by providing complete data on the effects of manufacturing processes and better enabling their optimization.  Innovative electronic device structures such as faster computer chips, and more powerful RF circuits require development of smaller and smaller devices employing more advanced materials.  The innovation that is being advanced through this Phase II program directly impacts this development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a deployable system to directly measure high-resolution mobility, resistivity, and carrier concentration profiles for high-mobility semiconductor materials.  Current electrical profiling methods provide partial data for these material systems that form the basis of the multi-billion dollar semiconductor logic device and RF/power chip industries.  The objectives of this Phase II program are to further demonstrate a prototype by developing and integrating high-reliability sub-systems to build a beta-level measurement tool with nm-level resolution.  This is expected to reduce the semiconductor wafer area needed to evaluate high-mobility materials, and develop the measurement capability to target all high-mobility materials with potential applications in IC and RF/power industries.

    of the lubricant industry. More beneficial impacts are anticipated as we expand
    the application of monounsaturated fatty acids into other industries, such as
    surfactants and polymers. A large commercial potential of this technology has
    been identified in the lubricant market, currently valued at $123B per annum,
    and predicted to grow to $178B per annum in the next 5-years. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    II project proposes to develop technology that will deliver novel bio-based monounsaturated
    fatty acids that provide new chemical structures allowing innovations in lubricants
    not possible from petroleum-based raw materials. Based on successful development
    of bacterial strains capable of producing enriched monounsaturated fatty acids
    in the Phase I project, the Phase II project will further de-risk the technology
    and scale up the capability to produce sufficient quantities of monounsaturated
    fatty acids to be evaluated by potential customers.  By optimizing and scaling
    up the fermentation process and developing the product extraction procedure, large
    quantity of the first generation product (55% enriched monounsaturated fatty acids)
    will be produced. It will be used to chemically synthesize high-performance lubricants
    (i.e., polyol esters), whose physical-chemical and tribological properties will
    be evaluated and provided to potential customers. In this project, metabolic engineering,
    system biology, and evolutionary strategies will be applied to further improve
    the strains for producing second generation products that are more enriched in
    monounsaturated fatty acids (70-80%) and achieve commercial viable technology
    metrics. The monounsaturated fatty acids are envisioned as platform chemicals
    for subsequent chemical conversion to numerous specialty chemicals that have applications
    in additional markets, such as surfactants and polymers."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in reducing the environmental impact of Aluminum production. Global production of aluminum from bauxite ore currently accounts for 1% of global electricity consumption, and 2.5% of CO2 emission. Over the last 15 years global production has doubled, and is expected to continue to increase over the next decades with expanded use in automotive applications. To meet increasing demand while reducing the environmental impact of production requires cost effective means of removing contaminating metals such as iron from aluminum. Commercial application of the technologies investigated here would positively affect the global aluminum industry and reduce its environmental impact. Applied to conventional primary production, the technology can be used to increase the yield from bauxite, or allow kaolinite clays to be used for primary production. The former will reduce the environmental and economic costs of production, while the latter would allow domestic producers to reduce their reliance on imported bauxite. If the technology is applied to primary production using carbothermic reduction, the impacts on the global aluminum industry would be even greater. Greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by up to 50%, and electricity consumption reduced by up to 20%.


    The objective of this Phase II SBIR research is to demonstrate a cost effective barrier centrifuge technology to remove contaminating elements from aluminum alloys. In the Phase I research we demonstrated the basic technology using a liquid gallium alloy instead of aluminum. In Phase II, we will fabricate an apparatus for handling liquid aluminum and characterize its purification efficiency and costs to own and operate. Using the barrier centrifuge to purify aluminum in secondary production would reduce the need for dilution by primary aluminum, thereby reducing the demand for the primary aluminum with a consequent reduction in electricity consumption, greenhouse gas production and waste disposal needs from the bauxite refining process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be to improve cleaning in the food processing industry by integrating hyper-stable enzymes into cleaning products. Industrial enzymes are a growing, multi-billion dollar green industry that reduces energy, water, and harsh chemical use while improving process efficiency in many sectors. Despite the broad use and success of industrial enzymes, their application and economic impact has been severely limited by narrow thermal and chemical operational ranges available. The company has developed heat and acid stable enzymes that significantly expand the reach of enzyme applications. The goal is to develop an initial product for the dairy cleaning market that will have the potential to increase production due to faster cleaning, achieve better removal of protein contaminants and biofilms, reduce water usage, and reduce food product exposure to chemicals and chemical waste. Better cleaning with enzymes has the potential to prevent food-borne illness, and decrease water use, while increasing food-processing profits and providing a biodegradable alternative to chemical cleaners.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using the first practical protein expression platform to produce hyperstable enzymes for commercial use. Although the genes from extreme organisms have been studied for over forty years, their commercial potential has not been realized due to their incompatibility with traditional protein expression systems. The unique hyperstability of enzymes produced using the company's technologies indicate that enzyme stability is not encoded entirely by gene sequence. In Phase II, the goal is to develop more comprehensive cleaning formulations and test these with laboratory and field trial methods established in Phase I. The project encompasses a set of integrated experiments spanning molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, dairy processor field trials, and practical industrial bioprocess optimization. The aim is to transform the world's most extreme enzymes into the world's most effective products for membrane defouling and sanitation in the dairy industry and beyond.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an imaging flow cytometer to enable high-throughput, precision analysis of biological cells for the drug discovery and biotechnology industries. The goal for this project is to provide order-of-magnitude throughput improvements versus other high content cell analysis technologies, which will ultimately lead to an increase in the efficiency of drug discovery. A high throughput imaging flow cytometer is an ideal solution for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as flow cytometry core facilities, because of the demand for higher throughput cellular analysis. In addition to drug discovery, the imaging capability of this flow cytometer will enable researchers to perform rare cell detection with higher precision than is currently available, and ultimately, in vitro hematology and oncology diagnostics using imaging flow cytometry. Finally, a high throughput flow cytometer with an order of magnitude greater throughput will dramatically reduce the time researchers spend in flow cytometry core facilities, ultimately enabling a general increase in biomedical research productivity.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to improve the efficiency of drug discovery by introducing a higher throughput, high content screening (HCS) instrument. HCS investigates the effects and associated mechanisms of action of therapeutic compounds by measuring multiple parameters from individual cells, typically using imaging. Although HCS has been highly effective in discovery new drugs, it, unfortunately, has significant throughput limitations. Namely, HCS requires data to be collected at the single cell level versus the population level. Typically, low-throughput readout techniques, such as flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging, are used to collect this data. This project aims to alleviate the speed limitations associated with imaging in drug discovery by introducing a high-throughput imaging flow cytometer capable of performing sub-cellular imaging at the speeds of traditional high throughput screening. The project leverages a high-speed fluorescence imaging modality based on frequency domain multiplexing, which was developed and demonstrated in Phase I, to provide market-leading imaging performance. Expanding this technology into a full flow cytometer by the end of Phase II, the goal is to have a 3-laser, 10-color imaging flow cytometer ready for researchers performing HCS as well as the general biomedical research community.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to offer custom crafted digital voices for text-to-speech applications. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint - an essential part of our self-identity. Though the quality of text-to-speech technology has improved, voice options remain limited. For the 2.5 million Americans (and tens of millions worldwide) living with voicelessness who rely on devices to talk, access to a custom digital voice is a game changer. It's the difference between a functional solution and being heard, uniquely, as oneself. Enhanced opportunities for social connection increase quality of life, independence, and access to educational and vocational resources that can narrow the gap between those with and without disability. This immediate unmet societal need, coupled with the increasing proliferation of devices that speak to us and for us, creates a compelling, timely and significant commercial opportunity for high quality, personalized digital voices that can be produced at scale. By leveraging the company's crowdsourced human voicebank and proprietary voice matching and blending algorithms the technology has the potential to empower everyone to express themselves through their own voice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support feasibility and commercialization of a customized voice building technology. The text-to-speech market, encompassing assistive technologies, enterprise and consumer applications, is currently valued at around $1B and is rapidly growing and ripe for innovation. To create custom voices, the company leverages the source-filter theory of speech production. From those who are unable or unwilling to record several hours of speech the company extracts a brief vocal sample - even a single vowel contains enough 'vocal DNA' to seed the personalization process. Identity cues of the source are then combined with filter properties of a demographically and acoustically matched donor in the company's voicebank. The result is a voice that captures the vocal identity of the recipient but the clarity of the donor. Phase II technical objectives address the need for 1) customer-driven voice customization, 2) quality assurance of crowdsourced recordings, 3) voice aging algorithms, and 4) targeted donor recruitment algorithms. These advances will help secure the assistive technology beachhead and spur innovations for broader applications such as virtual reality, personal robotics, and digital persona for the Internet of Things.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing a novel method of manufacturing
    micro sized parts in three-dimensions without layers at high volume.  With no
    parting lines, the technology represents a significant advancement over current
    state of the art molding and 3D technologies for certain applications.  As this
    represents an entirely new field of research, not merely an extension of solid

    in engineering and chemical disciplines.  More imminent is using the technology
    to create capillary electrophoresis (CE) chips that vastly reduce the amount of
    reagents, provide previously unattainable properties, and at a significantly lower
    price.  By doing so, the technology will accelerate and broaden the adoption of
    microfluidics which are currently used in applications such as forensics, genomics,
    drug making, drug analysis, clinical diagnostics, biosensors, and environmental
    testing, among countless others. \n \n\nThis project automates and expands a novel
    platform technology to manufacture high resolution micro parts. The technology
    is focused on a unique and inexpensive method to fabricate microfluidic channels
    and wells, which form the basis of all microfluidic chips. The objectives for
    Phase II are to: 1) Expand the versatility of the system by inclusion to the platform

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to
    deliver a cost-effective automated quality control (QC) system for manufacturing
    of radioactive drugs used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This system will
    replace current QC procedures, which involve 18 manual operations, 8 visual assessments,
    6 devices, and 8 samples of radioactive drugs. The industry's current reliance
    on manual operation, subjectivity and untraceable records impedes progress in
    radioactive drug manufacturing and presents compliance risks. Therefore, introduction
    of an automated system combining all these tests on a single platform will facilitate
    adoption of PET imaging technology beyond top tier medical centers. By addressing
    a critical current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliance need in radio-pharmaceutical
    production, which cannot be addressed with any other solutions available today,
    this solution is positioned for rapid adoption.  After adopting this system, it
    is expected that manufacturing facilities will realize 20% operating cost reduction
    and 50% reduction in time spent on QC-related activities. A reduced cost of compliance
    associated with introduction of automated QC will further contribute to the adoption
    rate.  This project will open the door to new applications of plate reader technology,
    an approach which has been traditionally confined to the fields of biochemistry
    and diagnostics.  \n\nThis Phase II effort includes four technical objectives.
    \ Firstly, the approach will be adapted to minimize the required sample volume.
    \ Methods developed in Phase I of the project required 0.5 ml of sample, a value
    which is not optimal for small manufacturers. To bring this value down to 0.2
    ml, test sensitivity will be adjusted, keeping in mind the potential dynamic range
    trade-offs.  Secondly, we will design a plastic consumable that supports adoption
    by a commercial manufacturer.  Current plastic prototype components are only suitable
    for academic sites with highly-skilled personnel.  To reduce the amount of training
    required, and to expand the applicability of this method, a new plastic component
    will be designed in order to further automate sample loading.  Third, we will
    optimize the formulation of the reagents to achieve a one-year shelf life for
    the consumable kit.  The shelf life of the reagents developed in Phase I remains
    unknown.  Therefore, accelerated stability studies will be performed to estimate
    the rates of decomposition processes, and appropriate changes will be made to
    enhance shelf life. Finally, we will develop a pilot production process for the
    newly-designed kit, in order to support early installations."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide the paint and coatings industry with new high-performance, cost-competitive polymer/resin systems that reduce solvent emissions and use of petrochemicals.  In addition, these new polymer/resin systems enable one-component, ambient-cure coatings to be produced.  This means that highly protective coatings can be produced without the need for mixing multiple components together prior to application or applying heat or light to cure the coatings.  The one-component, ambient-cure features of these polymer/resin systems largely eliminate waste and energy costs associated with coating application and lend themselves to the production of paints and coatings that can be applied by the average person.  Compared to the current state-of-the-art in one-component, ambient-cured resins, these new polymer/resin systems provide dramatically shorter drying times, dramatically better chemical resistance, and much higher film hardness, while exhibiting excellent impact resistance and flexibility.  The highly desirable properties of these new cost-competitive polymer/resin systems will enable commercial success, while their low solvent emissions and high renewable content will reduce impact on the environment.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to: 1) further optimize the polymer/resin systems to produce compositions that minimize solvent content and maximize performance, while meeting the cost constraints of the market; 2) put in place a pilot-line to provide potential customers with adequate sample sizes to enable their own evaluation of potential products, 3) generate weathering, corrosion, and storage/shelf stability data to further understand the application potential of optimized polymer/resin systems; and 4) optimize the polymer/resin production process to minimize cost and minimize production waste.  By meeting these objectives, the Phase II project will result in the generation of new polymer/resin systems that will enable the development and commercialization of new paints and coatings that are one-component, ambient-cured, low in solvent content that exhibit exceptional properties, while being primarily based on renewable materials.  Optimized polymer/resin systems will be provided to potential customers for their own internal evaluation.  If necessary, feedback from customer evaluations will be used to modify polymer/resin system composition to meet customer needs.  By the end of the Phase II project, the technology will be ready to proceed to manufacturing scale-up and product commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to produce a new type of computer memory called Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM). FEDRAM is cheap and can be mass-produced in current semiconductor manufacturing facilities. It also uses much less energy than current-state-of-the-art memories, and enables electronic devices to be much smaller in physical size. Commercially, FEDRAM works best as an embedded memory, which means they are ideally suited for products such as mobile phones where the processor and memory are on the same chip. Additionally, the same block of FEDRAM can be configured for high performance applications in addition to longer storage applications. This means that future devices will adapt to maximize power, performance, and usability. Due to the factors of price, performance, and low power, once FEDRAM is proven to work, it can potenitally be adopted in nearly every electronic device.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the commercialization questions of Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM).  In SBIR Phase I, it was shown that FEDRAM cells can be manufactured in an existing foundry with no new materials or equipment changes, and that FEDRAM has leading performance characteristics. The next step is to prove the same characteristics in an array, which would be considered a minimum viable product; this is the goal of SBIR Phase II. By proving this array,  it will be possible to quickly scale the FEDRAM memory array into embedded applications for commercial deployment.  The performance characteristics to be demonstrated are read/write latency, switching time, endurance, retention, and energy use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and produce a robust, hand-held, video-rate three-dimensional surface metrology system with vertical and lateral resolution of several micrometers, in order to bridge a critical existing metrology gap for precision-machined surfaces.  Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacturing and/or maintenance operations.  Current high-resolution surface measurement systems are slow, vibration-sensitive and laboratory-based and thus are impractical for everyday use by manufacturing technicians.  Meanwhile, shop-floor inspection is often only visual, and thus qualitative rather than quantitative, leading both to rejections of acceptable components as well as potential acceptance of failing ones.  The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs.  This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control.

    During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package.  This Phase II program leverages that research to design a video-rate, compact, robust and portable system for handheld surface measurements in shop-floor environments. This will first involve improvements to measurement resolution with an improved optical design and new self-calibrating measurement modes; new optical elements will lower noise artifacts caused by imperfections in the earlier design and to reduce system size.  Once performance of the new design is verified, an ergonomic, compact, robust, wireless housing for the instrument must be created to enable shop-floor use; the system must handle drops of over one meter onto concrete, have useful battery life for extended field operations, be light enough to not fatigue users and have intuitive controls and feedback.  A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments.  Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the creation of commercial viability for 3-D printing unique ceramic structures by transforming 3-D printing of advanced ceramics into mass-production additive manufacturing.  This will be a new capability for the US. The 3-D structures being considered can't be easily made with traditional manufacturing techniques but have significant advantages over traditionally manufactured geometries. If 3-D printed structures could be manufactured economically, the societal impact could be tremendous ranging from creation of hundreds of US manufacturing jobs to reduction in CO2 emissions. Commercially viable products that can improve existing markets and enable new markets are realistic expectations. Structures for improved filtration, catalytic production of clean fuels, H2 reformers, emission controls for stationary fuel cells, and CO2 sequestration have been inspired by Other Equipment Manufacturers and are already being jointly developed as a result of Phase I progress. Interestingly, these products and more could be produced from the same product lines just by changing a computer program. This great efficiency of infrastructure is a fortunate trait of additive manufacturing. In short, this project will position Robocasting Enterprises as a US exporter into world-wide markets for economic and societal benefit.

    This project is based on foundational technology called robocasting for 3-D printing ceramic materials.  Robocasting is an additive technique demonstrated to be useful for rapid fabrication of ceramics into advanced lattice structures for enhanced filtration and catalytic performance.  However, robocast products have been largely limited to products with dimensions less than 2 inches because of problems related to cracking. The goal of this project is to make additive manufacturing much more commercially viable for ceramics by: (a)  overcoming the technical challenges for robocasting large ceramic parts and; (b) designing and implementing a scaled-up manufacturing line commercially competitive with traditional manufacturing processes and production from low-wage countries. To achieve these goals; materials, processes, and equipment improvements are required.  Developments will include:  1) material innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 2) processing innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 3) equipment and automation innovations to increase production rates. At the end of Phase II it is anticipated that rapid manufacturing of large (i.e., 5-10 inch) advanced ceramic lattice structures will be demonstrated to be commercially viable and penetration into several markets will be significant.  The technology will be perfectly poised for investment from larger companies and Phase III growth.

    Research Phase II project will combine computational protein engineering (CPE)
    software, tools and methods into a \"platform technology\" that enables new products
    and technologies in a wide range of scientific areas, including industrial enzymes,
    pharmaceuticals, therapeutics, medical diagnostics and bioenergy. This project
    will validate the CPE platform in an application that has both commercial and
    environmental value:  engineered enzymes for utilizing methane as a feedstock.
    \ The engineered methane activating enzymes developed will open up numerous new
    biological routes to chemicals and fuels from natural gas, capitalizing on abundant
    domestic shale gas reserves and improving U.S. energy independence.  This CPE
    enzyme technology has the potential to significantly decrease the capital cost
    of small-scale Gas-to-liquid (GTL) plant, enabling the capture and monetization
    of otherwise economically-stranded natural gas.  In North Dakota, more than a
    quarter of the total gas produced is flared or vented, wasting a valuable natural
    resource and needlessly emitting greenhouse gases.  By facilitating the conversion
    of stranded or flared methane to fuels and high-value chemicals, this research
    can help reduce carbon footprint and spur domestic manufacturing, investment,
    and job creation. \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II project are to develop and
    license a CPE Platform technology that will enable experimental biological scientists
    to harness the power of computational protein design and engineering; to validate
    the CPE Platform technology by engineering novel methane activating enzymes that
    have increased soluble expression and methane-oxidizing activity; and in collaboration
    with potential licensees of this technology, work to incorporate the engineered
    enzyme into their industrial host organisms. These organisms will be enabled to
    use methane as a feedstock for the bio-production of a wide range of end products,
    including liquid transportation fuels, commodity chemicals and high value fine
    chemicals. In Phase I, the Northwestern-Caltech-Protabit team succeeded in engineering
    the particulate MMO (pMMO) catalytic subunit (spmoB) to allow it to be solubly
    expressed in E. coli.  This was the first demonstration of an active methane-oxidizing
    enzyme that can be solubly expressed and purified in significant quantities in
    a genetically-tractable recombinant host.  Phase II will continue this work, with
    the objective of making the spmoB enzyme more effective by increasing its activity
    and solving certain other challenges for inserting it into an industrial host."

    and sustainable alternative to traditional fired masonry materials.  This product
    is grown in ambient temperatures utilizing a natural calcium carbonate cement
    formation induced by a urease-producing microorganism. The Phase II project will
    focus on material testing and further optimization and cost reduction of biocement
    products, with the intention of demonstrating pilot manufacturing and rapid commercialization
    via licensee manufacturers. Using biologic products and fermentation procedures
    developed in the Phase I effort, improvements will be made to scale up manufacturing
    and reduce cost in the manufacturing process. The commercial potential of this
    technology is critically dependent on achieving cost and performance parity, if
    not superiority, with traditional materials.  Each year, 1.23 trillion fired bricks
    are produced globally for use in construction, resulting in over 800 million tons
    of carbon emissions.  The societal impacts of this research would include a dramatic
    reduction in these emissions, as well as a corresponding reduction in industrial
    by-product waste. This project will enhance the technological understanding for

    \nTechnical objectives for this effort include evaluation of the resulting biocement
    masonry products through rigorous American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM)
    testing methods, reduction of raw material costs through continued optimization,
    creation of in-house production capability for the requisite biologic product,

    testing for physical performance, weathering and durability, in-house production
    of robust raw material constituents, and commercial testing coupled with pilot
    manufacturing. Rigorous ASTM testing methods will be done at two accredited labs,
    and labor requirements will be reduced via the adoption of lean automation in
    the production process. Additionally, the utilization of existing material handing
    manufacturing equipment at licensee facilities, where possible, will be evaluated.
    Expected project results will include a comprehensive statistical analysis of

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. Using current methods, the oil industry is able to extract only 5% of the known hydrocarbon from shale formation. This represents more than $500B of potential oil and gas that cannot be economically produced for the US economy. The aim is to increase the efficiency of oil production by providing novel subsurface information to improve operational decision making. The resulting value increase for a producer can be up to $1M per well. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the hydraulic fracturing process, which is currently only 50% efficient. By providing novel subsurface data for the industry, this information can reduce environmental impact by saving up to 45B gallons of fresh water and 1M rail cars of mined sand. Furthermore, the analysis of subsurface microbiomes is a rich area for new academic knowledge.  Over 80% of the microbial strains identified in Phase I have never been documented in public references. This work not only provides economic and social value, but also expands scientific knowledge.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use next-generation microbiome analyses to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. The research objective is to analyze the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome to characterize hydrocarbon reservoirs and leverage this new data source to increase current efficiency rates. The goal is to analyze 50 producing wells in the Southwestern US, and develop statistical models linking microbial profiles to key reservoir properties that can increase production efficiencies. The analytical method employed will utilize technology stemming from over $20 million in government funding to the University of Colorado used to create bioinformatics software known as "QIIME."  The QIIME technology has been extensively tested in analyzing and modeling the human microbiome, but has never been applied to the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome prior to the Phase I work.  By combining advances in cloud computing, DNA sequencing, and novel software analytics, this project will demonstrate that these microbial communities correlate to meaningful production parameters for the oil and gas industry. In so doing, the project will demonstrate at pilot scale that this new information source can be utilized as a novel, non-invasive, low-cost reservoir characterization tool that allows the industry to maximize hydrocarbon production while minimizing environmental impact.

    focus on developing the process required to produce fiber reinforced polymer (FRP)
    rebar at scale.  FRP rebar offers significant performance advantages when compared
    to uncoated steel rebar.  These advantages include a sevenfold weight reduction,
    no corrosion - which in turn permits a 30% reduction in concrete usage (and a
    corresponding 15 billion ton reduction in CO2 emissions) - and equivalent tensile
    strength at smaller diameters compared to steel rebar products.  FRP rebar is
    being produced but has limited market acceptance due to its high cost.  The high-speed
    process to be developed in this project will allow price parity when compared
    to uncoated steel and enable a hundredfold improvement in process speeds compared
    to current FRP manufacturing.  Combined, these improvements will allow entry to
    the $140 billion global market for steel rebar and allow mass market adoption
    of FRP rebar.  Additionally, basalt mine waste will be explored and, where possible,
    utilized as a raw material for fiber production.  The broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project includes job creation and environmental impacts.  With
    implementation of this process up to 35 manufacturing jobs can be created immediately.
    \ \n \nThe company's high speed process combines a thermoset resin and basalt
    fiber as primary reinforcements within the FRP composite.  A consortium of pultruders
    has collectively organized the Fiber Reinforced Polymer Rebar Manufacturers Council
    and has developed FRP rebar into a viable product over the last 20 years, with
    a $1.2 billion market at present.  Currently, no FRP rebar product is offered
    at price parity with uncoated steel rebar, and to reach this price parity a high
    speed process has been invented.  This novel process will be optimized and further
    developed by the completion of this Phase II SBIR project.  Basalt fiber, an emerging
    material with the potential to replace carbon and other fibers in a variety of
    applications will be brought into large-scale industrial usage with the completion
    of this project.  The Phase I project permitted the determination of the performance
    characteristics of thermoset resins which have not been commonly used in pultrusion,
    enabling product validation.  This Phase II project will address a range of manufacturing
    challenges that will be encountered in the production of FRP rebar at industrial
    scale, allowing a commercially viable final product that can be offered at price
    parity with steel rebar."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on establishing full-scale production parameters, quality control procedures, operational testing and commercialization of cutting-edge compartmentalized vacuum composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in cold chain shipping, storage, building insulation, automobiles, aerospace and other advanced markets. The first application is in the cold chain shipping industry, for packaging and storage of temperature sensitive materials. A new generation of thin (less than 1"), light weight, highly insulated (R value 25-30), durable, and long service life boxes will meet a critical need in this area. Temperature-sensitive products such as vaccines, blood, organs, and diagnostic specimens are shipped using insulated containers, and the new materials to be developed will permit longer shipping duration, higher impact resistance, and re-usability. The cold chain shipping market includes the Red Cross, blood banks, pharmacies, clinical trial shippers, diagnostic centers, life science material providers and whole sale distributors. The annual United States market potential in life sciences packaging is estimated at $291 million.  The resulting materials also have significant potential for uses in permanent and temporary structures, and in a variety of transportation applications.

    Successful completion of the Phase I work has resulted in cost-effective (an order of magnitude lower expected cost), stronger (ten times the impact resistance of Styrofoam), lightweight, thin (less than 1"), highly-insulating (R 16-22), compartmentalized vacuum composite materials.  An exclusive machining capability was also demonstrated, whereby vacuum composites can be cut and sized on-site without degradation in thermal performance, an issue which affects current vacuum insulation panels (VIPs).  Optimization of the developed composites to achieve targeted insulation rating, cost, and service life characteristics will be conducted during Phase II. Thermal performance, mechanical characteristics and operational performance will be evaluated for their application in cold chain shipping and in building/structural insulation. The team will also validate boxes fabricated using these materials in cold chain shipping to verify safe transportation of blood products, organs, and/or pharmaceuticals.  Based on the Phase II work, it is anticipated that these materials will be poised to replace petroleum-based foam materials and vacuum insulation panels as a high-performance and economical solution in these markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) II project is to help detect whether pharmaceuticals about to be administered to patients have been damaged during shipment or storage by exposure to very cold  temperatures close to or below the freezing temperature of water. Many pharmaceuticals, especially vaccines, lose their potency if exposed to near-freezing conditions. In light of tightening regulations with respect to the temperature-controlled storage and distribution of pharmaceuticals and changing distribution models (increase in direct-to-patient shipments), there is a critical need to demonstrate with greater reliability and in a cost-effective manner whether pharmaceuticals lose their potency due to exposure to harmful temperatures. The result of this SBIR II project will be an indicator that will provide workers along the pharmaceutical supply chain information about whether a pharmaceutical encountered harmful temperatures and the duration of such an encounter. Both harmful temperature and duration of exposure are critical pieces of data required to determine whether a pharmaceutical has been compromised. Technologies do exist that indicate whether an exposure to a harmful temperature has occurred, however, the indication of time of exposure is muddled and difficult to discern. The proposed research in this Phase II SBIR program, if successful, will offer a reliable alternative to costly electronic devices. The benefits of this device include preventing damaged product from reaching patients, helping companies remain in compliance with regulations in a cost-effective manner and reducing pharmaceutical waste.

    This  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  Phase  II  project  aims  to  develop  Time Temperature Indicators (TTIs) that reliably indicate exposure of pharmaceutical shipments to harmful cold temperatures near the freezing point of water. This technology will be the first chemical-based technology capable of indicating the duration of such exposures. If a harmful exposure occurs, the combination of time and temperature data provided by these indicators can be used by the shipper to evaluate whether a pharmaceutical was truly compromised. As a result, pharmaceuticals that have been truly compromised are discarded and not administered to the patient. The patented indicators utilize a specially formulated polymer hydrogel that undergoes a volume transition from a swollen to a collapsed state upon cooling. The kinetics and the temperature dependence of the transition are highly tunable. The objectives of this Phase II project include refining formulations and synthesis methods to prepare polymer gels with highly reliable swollen-shrunken transitions. These gels will then be incorporated into specially designed housings to obtain TTI prototypes. Simple manual-driven machines will be designed to prepare the TTI prototypes. The performance of these TTIs will be validated: the company will demonstrate that these TTIs meet a minimum quality requirement. Thereafter the project will test the stability of the TTIs by measuring performance after accelerated storage and the proposed TTI prototypes will be subjected to standard transit tests. As the reliability of these indicators is a key product attribute, this project will identify the synthesis and process steps that introduce variability and address them accordingly.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in removing sulfur compounds from various
    fuels such as diesel, gasoline and mixture of refined fuels known as transmix.
    It is critically important to reduce sulfur levels below 10 ppm as the emissions
    from transportation vehicles can cause acid rain and associated undesired effects.
    Sulfur removal from fuels is even more critical for implementation of fuel cell
    technologies due to fuel reformer catalyst poisoning at sulfur levels as low as
    1 ppm or below. Finally, there is a need for sulfur-tolerant catalysts and sulfur
    removal processes in value added chemical production using bio-derived and fossil
    derived fuels. The global market for hydro-desulfurization catalysts in the transportation
    fuel segment is estimated at over $1B and growing fast. The company's proposed
    catalyst could address a market size of $150-200M/yr or more. It may find additional
    applications in commercial markets in ultra-low sulfur diesel, fuel reformer technology
    and sulfur tolerant catalysts. The development of a scalable manufacturing method
    for advanced materials undertaken in this project will contribute to U.S. competitiveness
    and strengthen Cleantech and energy sectors in the state of KY. \n\n\n\nThis project
    addresses the development of high performance catalysts needed for the removal
    of sulfur from hydrocarbon fuels. However, sulfur removal at concentrations below
    50 ppm is difficult due to the presence of hetero-cyclic thiophenic species. During
    Phase I, the company developed a catalyst product and demonstrated its performance
    in terms of ultra-deep hydrodesulfurization activity, reducing sulfur levels from
    200 ppm to much lower than 1 ppm in a variety of fuels. Phase II studies will
    allow optimization of the catalysts for hydrodesulfurization activity and mechanical
    properties. Catalysts with bi-functional activity toward aromatics hydrogenation
    and hydrodesulfurization will reduce several process steps, thereby reducing the
    costs involved in hydroprocessing of fuels. Phase II studies will enable development
    of a process for scalable production of nanowires. The fundamental insight from
    the performance can be extended toward designing various high performance catalysts
    using nanowire supports. Some beneficial effects using nanowire supports include
    unique active metal/support interactions; single crystal surfaces for uniform
    morphologies for active metals and their alloys and management of active sites.
    Specifically, in the case of hydrodesulfurization, nanowire supports provided
    an easier diffusion pathway for sulfur transfer to maintain active metal sites
    for desulfurization activity."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the high costs of manufacturing protein therapeutics, or biologics. Biologics are a growing category of therapeutic that can treat a range of diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to ulcerative colitis to Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, producing these highly effective therapeutics is extremely expensive, with most of the cost stemming from the purification of the target protein from a complex mixture. This Phase II project aims to develop a new filter device that makes purifying biologics faster and cheaper. The filter media will increase overall throughput, thereby easing bottleneck steps in the purification process. In addition to decreased manufacturing costs, the expedited purification also increases the overall capacity of the manufacturing line. This high throughput filter device is designed to fit seamlessly into existing purification modules, making it easy for end users to increase production efficiencies.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to dramatically improve the performance of ultrafiltration membranes used in protein separations. Currently existing ultrafiltration membranes suffer from either prohibitively low throughputs or broad pore sizes, limiting their efficacy in separation processes. This project takes advantage of a unique class of polymeric materials, known as block copolymers, to make membranes that overcome the previous structural limitations. Namely, the block copolymer membranes have very high throughputs and very uniform pore sizes. These important features are possible due to the distinct ability of block copolymers to self-assembly into periodic, ordered structures with length scales relevant for protein separations. Using a combination of block copolymer self-assembly and non-solvent induced phase separation, membranes with targeted pore sizes can be made in scalable way. The research objectives for this project are to increase the porosity of the supporting block copolymer material, attach the block copolymer membrane to a fabric backing, evaluate the performance of assembled membrane sheet stock, and package the sheet stock into a device configuration. Accomplishing these research objectives will result in a mechanically robust, easy to implement membrane material that can increase the rate of protein filtration by 3-10 fold.

    at optimizing production of a bio-surfactant in preparation for commercial launch
    of the product.  During Phase I, the company developed an engineered microorganism
    that synthesizes the surfactant, and a key customer confirmed the identity and
    purity of a sample of the surfactant.  During Phase II, synthetic biology methods
    will be used to increase the efficiency of the microorganism producing the surfactant.
    \ In addition, multiple samples of purified surfactant will be shipped to customers
    for evaluation.  Customer feedback will identify any product features that require
    modification and will result in development of a detailed product specification,
    which will include metrics such as:  purity, color, acceptable variation in composition
    and molecular weight, etc.  The objectives of this Phase II project are to optimize
    surfactant characteristics and microbial production efficiency so that the surfactant
    can be profitably manufactured and sold for use in consumer products formulations.\n
    \ \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it should
    enable the company to demonstrate that synthetic biology methods can be used to
    increase the efficiency of production of a bio-surfactant so the surfactant can
    be sold as a commercial product.  Progress toward that goal should enable the
    company to attract a partner, for example a large chemical company, who will agree
    to collaborate on commercialization of the bio-surfactant.  If the bio-surfactant
    can be made and sold profitably, the company will be positioned to fund future
    research and development aimed at commercial launch of additional bio-surfactants.
    \ Benefits to society are that chemicals produced using this technology will be
    manufactured using domestically grown renewable raw materials, which do not compete
    with food.  Furthermore, the energy required to produce these chemicals is low
    since the fermentation reaction is performed near ambient temperature.  The chemicals
    are inherently safer than traditional chemicals because toxic solvents are not
    used, and the surfactants are biodegradable and do not contribute to increased
    greenhouse gas accumulation.  These bio-surfactants will initially be used in
    personal care products, such as body washes and shampoos.  However, the surfactant
    market is large and diverse, creating an opportunity for use of bio-surfactants
    in products as varied as laundry detergent, paints and coatings, and floatation-agents
    used in the mining industry to purify valuable minerals."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a working prototype of a handheld detector for trace explosives that is smaller, more sensitive, and has faster response times than any commercially available portable device today. Under NSF Phase I SBIR funding of this project, Vaporsens, Inc. successfully developed new organic nanofiber sensory materials required to achieve these goals. In Phase II, the company will design and optimize the sensor systems, electronic hardware, firmware and algorithm software required to build a handheld detector. The novel nanofiber sensory materials developed by Vaporsens will enable the proposed detector to simultaneously detect all three important categories of explosives with greater sensitivity, due to detection limits in the parts per trillion range. Prototypes will be subjected to third party testing to validate the rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of common explosives. The Phase II project will also permit the design and fabrication of new sensor materials, with the aim of further improving the sensing sensitivity and selectivity of subsequent devices through interface chemistry optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the project will reduce the impact of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) which are a leading cause of casualties in contemporary warfare. IED use outside of warfare is growing, with over 170 incidents reported in the US alone during the first six months of 2013. As a result, the worldwide annual sales for trace explosives detection equipment has grown to approximately $400 million. However, these technologies are limited in their effectiveness. Swabbing machines require contact; bomb-sniffing dogs are expensive, need to work with the same handler, and have limited endurance; and imaging technologies are only practical in checkpoint settings due to size and expense. In contrast, the small size and high sensitivity of the proposed detector will be used for exacting detection of trace amounts of explosives in nearly any location, without swabbing, and at a cost that meets or exceeds the lowest price of detectors on the market. The commercialized device will be the first of its kind to allow local law enforcement and other public safety officials, border security and the military to "sniff" suspicious bags, vehicles, lockers, and people for dangerous explosive threats with immediate results regardless of their location.

    Nanofiber Separations, LLC will establish an innovative type of bioseparation
    media utilizing electrospun nanofiber felts/mats of regenerated cellulose with
    high specific surface area as the support for protein adsorption ligands. Compared
    to competitive products (e.g., packed resin beads or microfiber adsorption membranes),
    these nanofiber membranes/felts will provide greatly enhanced throughput (i.e.,
    shorter processing times), reduce the amount of waste generated, and decrease

    for purification of high-value biopharmaceutical products. The SBIR Phase I project
    was completed successfully by developing a manufacturing process for the functionalized
    nanofiber felts and proving superior performance compared to commercial products.
    This SBIR Phase II project will focus on further optimization of the formulations
    used during production of the nanofiber adsorbents for bioseparations. This will
    include two scale-up steps needed for the commercial manufacturing effort anticipated
    during the Phase II timeline (nanofiber felt production, surface functionalization,
    and module development). Key technical improvements, including greater product
    stability and a broader array of functional ligands needed in bioseparations,

    In contrast to other techniques, CRS is a label-free method that requires excitation

    tunable wavelengths (<1nm). The key innovation of the Phase I proposal was the
    realization that the difference frequency of the two major gain media used in
    the telecommunication industry, Erbium and Ytterbium, corresponds to the wavelength
    range where most CRS imaging is performed. This provided a path to an economical
    laser source for CRS based on a robust all-fiber implementation of low-cost telecom

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the development of a technology to improve the way drugs are delivered in the body. Less than 2% of the dose of any medication finds its way to the place in the body where it is needed. The other 98% is either eliminated or, even worse, concentrates in areas where they can lead to side effects. This happens with all medications from daily anti-inflammatory drugs to the latest cancer therapies. If successful, this new approach will turn a regular drug into a medicine that is concentrated and activated only at the area where it is needed. This advance should increase the efficacy of the therapy and minimize its side effects. For example, the local drug activation can target chemotherapies to tumors with minimal side effects. Antibiotics could be delivered at higher local doses than is currently possible, eliminating local infections and limiting the creation of drug-resistant bacteria. Anti-inflammatory medications could be more powerful, improving the management of post-operative pain, potentially reducing the use and misuse of opioid drugs. Overall, this technology could reduce the costly burden of adverse drug events, estimated at more than $177 billion.

    To create targeted medicines, researchers rely on the endogenous differences between diseased tissue and the rest of the body (e.g., molecular markers or differences in enzymatic activity). Local drug activation provides a new path to create targeted medicines. The approach starts by injecting a biodegradable polymer at the desired site. The material contains exogenous chemical activators that do not exist anywhere else in the body. Then a drug is given systemically that is inactive until it comes in contact with the gel improving local efficacy and diminishing systemic side effects. Phase 1 results showed that an inactivated chemotherapy eliminated tumors in mice after only 10 days of therapy with minimal side effects. The Phase II project will expand the benefits of the local drug activation platform to other therapies, including cancer therapies and pain medications. The long-term goal is to show the applicability of the approach to multiple classes of drugs and increase their potential to improve outcomes for diseases that affect local areas of the body. If successful, this advance should enable medications for people who are too frail to receive them and enable therapies to work in combinations that were previously impossible due to dose-limiting toxicities.

    to develop precision-guided delivery of drugs or diagnostic compounds to the site
    of damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is quite common; every year, over
    10 million people worldwide injure their brain, and it is the most common cause
    of death and disability in young people. There are currently no drugs available
    that would limit the additional damage to the brain from swelling and inflammation
    after the injury or help repair the brain. The company's technology allows one
    to guide a drug to the injured brain and keep it there until it has done its job,
    while less of the drug goes to normal tissues. This way, it will be possible to
    use drugs that, while beneficial in brain injury, may do damage elsewhere. It
    also makes it possible to use new types of drugs that would otherwise not reach
    their target in the brain. If the company is successful in bringing this technology
    to the clinic, it may make brain injury victims better, and significant savings
    to the healthcare system may also be obtained. \n\nThe proposed project will develop
    a highly efficacious technology platform for site-specific delivery of drugs to
    acute brain injury. The main reasons for the failure of neuro-protective agents
    in clinical trials are lack of specificity and the dose limiting effects of the
    therapy. Targeted delivery can circumvent this problem. In Phase I, the company
    described a novel peptide, CAQK, which specifically delivers various types of
    payloads to sites of brain injury from systemic administration. Developing improved
    variants of this peptide with high affinity and stability is important in ensuring
    optimal clinical translation of this technology. The objective of this project
    is to optimize the delivery platform by exploring different modifications of the
    CAQK peptide, and to use high throughput screening of chemical compound libraries
    to search for compounds that reproduce the CAQK activity. The outcome of this
    Phase II application will be a panel of stable, long-circulating, high affinity
    peptides and/or small molecule chemical mimetics that can be used for targeted
    drug delivery to injured brain. The most promising compounds will be validated
    in animal models of brain injury. Transformative advances in brain injury treatment

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be focusing on automatic pairing and provisioning of Internet of Things (IoT) for the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry, to help them increase revenue potential by digitizing their apartments. It is estimated that the Smart Home Automation industry will reach $71B by 2018. If installation and setup of IoT devices could be automated and simplified then the MFH industry could roll out Smart Apartments quickly and in large scale. Being able to gather data and insights on buildings could lead to increased revenue from more efficient use of labor and materials and through better management of energy. It also gives them the opportunity to create new revenue streams from software and services targeted at the data output. The MFH industry can also get insights on their entire building portfolio versus a single building and more efficiently manage their entire portfolio. The MFH industry implementing Smart Home Automation technology has huge societal benefits by integrating with smart grids and utility demand response programs. The potential energy savings of 18M Smart Apartments could be hundred thousand gigawatt hours or $7.3B in savings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to enable the deployment of a scalable and maintainable infrastructure through the use of mechanisms including automatic pairing, tiered authentication, and network isolation in low cost, resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The problem with existing IoT pairing methods is that they are targeted at Single-Family-Home deployments and the number of nodes that needs to be paired are relatively minimal. However, this is not a scalable model when trying to address the needs of the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry. In the multi-family dwelling, the sheer density of nodes creates new problems. The technical challenge that remains for this phase is to ensure that all the devices will easily pair and to differentiate the nodes so that they authenticate and provision to the right apartment in a dense, RF noisy environment. Developing a cost effective, scalable solution for this high-density scenario is a key component to fulfilling the value proposition of mass deployment in the Multi-Family-Home industry. The anticipated result of this project is to solve the issue of pairing large quantities of end nodes and authenticating them appropriately to the correct apartment.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to disrupt hemodialysis delivery for treating end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a significant health burden in the US. Trends are moving toward patient-managed, in-home treatments. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate adoption of safer home hemodialysis therapy through development of continuously operating, wearable hemodialysis systems enabled by ultrathin and highly permeable silicon nanomembranes. Despite the recognized economic, health and quality-of-life benefits of more frequent hemodialysis treatments, adoption of home hemodialysis using present systems is being limited by doctors? and patients? safety concerns. Simpler and safer hemodialysis therapies will require breakthroughs in both device components and form-factors. The development of a small-scale, highly efficient dialysis system enabled by silicon nanomembranes holds potential for increasing adoption of home dialysis and its related benefits for the 430,000 US ESRD patients.

    Phase I results demonstrated feasibility of methods for large area nanomembrane fabrication, strengthened membranes and identified membrane area requirements for a dialysis system embodiment. Phase II objectives focus on completing larger area membrane fabrication, optimization of membrane filtration properties, integration of membranes into dialyzer modules and testing dialysis efficacy of these dialyzer modules in a nephrectimized sheep model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in reducing the energy consumption from air and gas compression.  In the United States, industrial air compressors consume over 12% of manufacturing electricity consumption, or 399 trillion BTU.  5% of natural gas production in the US is consumed by compression to move the gas to the end-user.  On a global basis, compressors driven by electric motors are estimated to consume 32% of the electricity consumption from electric motor driven systems, or 2,267 terawatt hours per year.  At $0.10 per kilowatt hour, this translates into nearly $227 billion of annual electricity costs for compression. Carnot's technology has the potential to reduce energy consumption from compression by 20% or more across multiple compression applications. By reducing the energy consumed for air and gas compression, the technology will reduce the carbon footprint of industrial and commercial activity in the US and internationally.



    Isothermal compression has been thought unachievable due to the requirement of rapidly capturing the heat of compression. The Phase I project allowed us to integrate proven design elements from prior prototypes, along with a complete liquid recirculation and heat dissipation system, into a single platform. This project will build upon research performed under the Phase I project to bring our compression technology to commercial readiness. A 2-year research and development plan will be executed to address key systems engineering elements of the technology to achieve commercial ready status.  A combination of lab experiments, thermodynamic modeling, design, engineering, and benchtop prototyping will be used to develop a commercial ready system design that can be applied to a broad range of industrial compression applications.  Further study and exploitation of isothermal compression may lead to an ever-evolving field of application, potentially creating additional areas of research and learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the challenge of fouling on membranes used in biopharmaceutical processing. The successful application of this coating would enable increase in the membrane lifetime and product yield of various production streams as less of the valuable compounds remain trapped in the membrane. This can increase production capacity for life-saving medicines, reduce production costs and, in certain cases, enable continuous biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Furthermore, functionalization of membranes currently involve significant quantities of environmentally harmful solvents, which may be leachable during usage of the membrane. This issue is avoided in the current project by utilizing initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process which does not require any solvent. This coating technology can also be extended to other systems including wastewater purification, food & beverage production, industrial separations, and medical devices that rely on a similar functionalization.

    The objective of Phase II will be to demonstrate a commercially viable manufacturing process to produce surface modifications within porous membranes using the iCVD process. Previous work in this subject has focused on top-coats on the top surfaces of reverse osmosis membranes, but the chemistries utilized have never before been demonstrated within interior structures of the membrane filters. During the Phase II work, the performance of the coatings will be optimized by using existing deposition equipment to tune the coating chemistry and process conditions to maximize the flux and throughput by minimizing protein fouling. The other main technical goal of the work will be to translate the current batch process into a continuous roll-to-roll process that is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. The outcome of this study will be a proven coating chemistry that is effective and durable in the membrane application, and an optimized manufacturing process capable of being implemented within current standards of membrane manufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the potential dollars saved in healthcare costs to environmental protection. The greatest overall savings cannot be judged only in dollars, but in helping to preserve human lives and end diseases and illnesses caused by problems with water. The product will provide unique opportunity to populations to test their water for safety and health benefits, in locations where good water treatment facilities do not exist. The water testing equipment market is divided into low-end, low-cost on-field test equipment (such as nitrate strip) that gives qualitative information about the analytes, and high-end testing devices used in labs (such as mass spectrometer) providing accurate quantitative information. If successful, the sensor technology will bridge the gap by providing low-cost, sensitive, accurate tools for quantitative measurement of analytes. The portable, low-cost, plug and play sensor product will cater to the needs of the water quality monitoring market. The product will also mobilize ?citizen scientist? to partake in environmental data collection and popularize sustainability education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is expected to lead to the development of a multiplexed, low-cost, portable instrument capable of making real time measurements of nitrate and phosphate in water and soil samples. The sensor system for this instrument will be based on the highly selective nitrate and phosphate reducing working electrodes along with reagents contained in the microfluidics to perform real-time sensing without sample preparation. As the concentrations of phosphate in solution are usually small, and since the inorganic phosphate in a water sample is changing due to biological processes, time is often a critical factor in taking measurements of phosphate. Due to these factors, there is a need for sensitive, inexpensive, and portable instruments in order to monitor the eutrophication process effectively. Currently available instruments for making phosphate measurements in the field do not adequately address these needs. Phase I development showed that disposable electrode with microfluidic integration, and smartphone app controlled sensor is capable of detecting nitrate with high sensitivity and specificity. Phase II proposal is focused on commercialization of the nitrate sensor and development of multiplexed sensor platform to detect multiple ions such as nitrate, and phosphate for larger commercial market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project answers the call that science students go beyond memorizing facts to understand content on a deeper, conceptual level. In chemistry, this goal is particularly difficult to achieve because the underlying concepts describe the behaviors of particles that are not directly observable to students. College instructors are also under added pressure to transform their teaching methods to help ensure student retention and success. In the subject area of organic chemistry, this transformation is even more important, due to the relatively high fail-rate in the course, especially for under-represented minorities and first generation students. The mobile learning tools and data collection platform in this project would help to solve both of these issues with an innovative method for intuitive learning and assessment which helps to make molecules and reactions come alive with game-based mobile applications. The game apps are playable by students of all ages, so the concepts of organic chemistry, as well as other science courses, become familiar and accessible as early as middle school. The broader vision is to open the pipeline for students to progress into STEM careers which have been difficult to reach in the past.

    This project makes the theoretical touchable for organic chemistry students by building mobile game-based learning tools based on mechanisms, a key underlying concept used to teaching the course. This project will produce the Mechanisms suite of game apps, and bring an intuitive, tactile interface to learning chemistry. The research and development of this phase of the project will expand the user interaction model from Phase I to multiple modules of content for students. The data from the mobile learning tools will be synthesized with machine learning techniques to create an adaptive method to ensure the applications provide the appropriate level of challenge to the student learner. Clinical and longitudinal efficacy studies will be part of the research effort as the game modules are developed and released. The data platform will be optimized to integrate with multiple learning management systems and to be readily expandable to subjects beyond organic chemistry. The dashboard of the platform will allow both instructors and students to access the data and inform learning processes to achieve greater comprehension and success in the course. Commercialization will be achieved through direct-to-student downloads, subscriptions of the data platform by institutions, and licensing the technology to courseware providers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is for the development of scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end-user moldable advanced composite materials for use in protective athletic equipment. Currently, protective athletic equipment and accessories must be produced using industrial manufacturing techniques that have high tooling costs. As a result, manufacturers produce a small range of predetermined sizes and shapes, which do not provide a custom fit for end users. In the case of athletic gear, there is a growing market for hard-shell protective equipment which can be custom molded for a better fit. Polyimine polymers and advanced composites offer a compelling blend of strength and malleability in order to create more user-friendly lightweight and durable advanced composites that may be shaped by the end-user. In addition to creating greater user customization, both the virgin polyimine polymer, and advanced composites that incorporate polyimines, are intrinsically recyclable in a closed-loop, low-energy, solution-based system. The total U.S. composite materials market is $25 billion, representing 36% of the global composites sector. Polyimine polymers and advanced composite derivatives will reduce environmental waste and increase manufacturing efficiencies across a broad range of vertical markets in the composites sector including personal protective equipment, aerospace, automotive, and infrastructural materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development of the unique chemistry of polyimine polymers. Polymers can be broadly grouped into two categories, thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are strong due to the chemical characteristics of the plastic. However, once cured, thermosets cannot be reshaped. As a result, thermosets are neither repairable, nor are they efficiently recyclable. In contrast, thermoplastics, which are weaker than thermosets, may be molded and remolded. However, remolding requires very high temperatures. Polyimine polymers represent a new class of moldable and remoldable thermoset materials. Importantly, these polymers combine high rigidity and tough mechanical properties with mild molding temperatures. This Phase II research project will include scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end user moldable composite materials that are a maximum of one-quarter inch in thickness and meet industry standards for limb joint protective equipment. The Phase II effort will also include a variety of types of material and mechanical testing, both in-house and at certified laboratories, in addition to extensive efforts at proving out manufacturability, as well as pilot production.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase global access to vaccines
    and reduce mortality associated with infectious diseases. As an example, Rotavirus
    is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children and lack of vaccination
    results in 450,000 deaths annually. A thermostable rotavirus vaccine would create
    cost-savings for vaccine manufacturers, national governments, and non-profit vaccine
    buyers and enable market access in areas of the world that lack sufficient cold-chain
    capacity. Successful development of a stable rotavirus vaccine would not only
    have significant positive impact on global rotavirus immunization efforts, but
    may also revolutionize the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution.
    This Phase II project will advance towards commercialization a novel platform
    technology that both stabilizes vaccines and enables novel delivery formats. This
    technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied
    to numerous emerging and existing vaccines in the $24 Billion global market. \n\nThe
    proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of silk to meet the global
    need for robust, thermostable vaccines. Thermal instability is a long-standing
    problem in vaccine development. Despite efforts to improve stability, current
    formulation approaches do not allow product storage under ambient conditions.
    Temperature excursions during shipment and storage are common and result in wastage
    or administration of suboptimal vaccines. The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost
    biomaterial, represents a novel approach to vaccine stabilization. The goal of
    the proposed research is to advance the silk-stabilization platform towards commercialization
    of vaccines that do not require cold storage. Building upon successful Phase I
    results, advanced formulation optimization studies will define a final product
    formulation for rotavirus that is compatible with scaled manufacturing and achieves
    all storage and in vivo attributes necessary for a commercial product. Through
    process optimization studies, fabrication of a dissolvable thin strip for oral
    delivery of rotavirus will be translated into a scalable manufacturing process
    that provides an attractive alternative to traditional drying methods. Evaluation
    of stabilized rotavirus vaccine films in an improved animal model will enable
    validation of in vivo immunogenicity and offer insight into vaccine stabilization
    and oral film delivery more broadly."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robust, in-line plasmonic sensor for the detection of mercury in natural gas. Mercury naturally contaminates natural gas at the parts per million levels and can corrode critical aluminum components in processing facilities. Heat exchangers at Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plants have failed catastrophically due to mercury corrosion, costing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and injuring workers.  Current monitoring methods cannot operate at the high pressures found in the process gas lines, leading to inaccurate measurements and unreliable instruments. LNG is a growing share of global energy as natural gas replaces more carbon intensive fossil fuels. By 2020, 30 LNG plants will be operating world wide, for a total mercury monitoring market of $136 million. Mercury monitoring at petrochemical facilities broadly is a $216 million per year market.  Mercury itself is a neurotoxin and a global pollutant; our sensor has the potential to aid in efforts to detect and remove mercury before it can impact human health. Beyond mercury, plasmonic sensing is a novel technology with applications for a variety of chemical and biological species.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the utilization of a novel sensing platform based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a gold nanoparticle film. It will build upon the success of the Phase I project, which demonstrated the suitability of LSPR sensors for the detection of elemental mercury vapor. This Phase II project will proceed along two objectives. The first objective will be to adapt the sensor for operations at high pressure; included in this objective is the redesign of key components of the system and the construction of a high-pressure test bench.  The second objective is testing the LSPR sensor in a natural gas matrix; preliminary results indicate that LSPR mercury sensors response well in methane, but the full range of response and lifetime performance will be investigated in this project. Upon completion of these two objectives, field trials will commence. The full system will be certified for use in a gas plant and demonstrated at a suitable natural gas plant. A commercial prototype LSPR based natural gas mercury monitor will be realized upon completion of this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop and commercialize an innovative coating which minimizes the accumulation of mineral fouling on industrial heat exchanger surfaces.  Heat exchangers are used to heat or cool fluids in industrial processes, such as chemical manufacturing, oil refining, power generation, food processing, electronics manufacturing, and many more.  Air conditioning for factories and large commercial buildings also represents a significant use of heat exchangers.  Fouling occurs when naturally dissolved minerals in water, often called "hard" water, precipitate out of the water when it contacts a hot surface.  This fouling can be seen in a typical home on the surface of a teakettle or showerhead.  The resulting mineral crystals adhere strongly, and form an insulating layer that materially reduces the thermal efficiency of industrial heat exchangers.  Mineral fouling is estimated to cost U.S. industry $40 Billion per year, and waste $3 Billion of energy, representing upwards of 1% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to wasting energy, this worldwide, never-ending problem increases factory downtime and maintenance costs, causes industry to spend large amounts on chemical treatment of water supplies, and decreases the useful life of heat exchanger systems.  An effective coating will result in substantial environmental benefits including the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the wasted energy, and a reduction of the water treatment chemicals, which eventually enter community wastewater streams.

    The coating material is a low surface energy, self-assembling hydrophobic material which is a composite of a host polymer and a nanoparticle. The low surface energy of the coating impedes the attachment of the minerals to the coated heat transfer surface. Phase I results showed that any fouling accumulation on a coated surface exhibits low adhesion strength, which allows any fouling that does occur to predominantly be dislodged by the force of the water flowing over it - a phenomenon call "self-cleaning."  The coating is very thin - less than 500 nm - which minimizes impedance of heat transfer due to the presence of the coating itself.  Phase II research will focus on optimizing the properties of the coating, including substrate adhesion, surface energy, and toughness to ensure a useful life under industrial conditions.  This will be accomplished by changing the host polymer chemistry to facilitate self-assembly, and also by changing the chemistry of the nanoparticle to obtain a covalent bond between the host polymer and nanoparticle.  Work will also be performed to design the application process for industrial scale, and validate lab results with field trials at industrial sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for the realization of a commercial millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring product that can help neurosurgeons in treating patients with hydrocephalus. While the goal of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of said ICP monitor, the technology can also be translated to the development of 'smart dust', opening up the next generation of computing paradigm. This will mark a significant milestone towards massive-scale realization of internet of things, dramatically accelerating the technology adoption and research impact of millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. The technology adoption can be introduced to multiple markets including, but not limited to, medical, industrial, and consumer spaces. This would open up many new commercial opportunities that were previously limited by energy consumption and size, heralding a new era of computing in an unprecedented form factor and lifetime.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for improved treatment of hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the brain's ventricle area, causing head enlargement, epilepsy, and death. The only practical treatment for hydrocephalus is surgical implant of medical shunts, which relieves excess CSF to other parts of the body. The biggest problem with existing shunts is that they lack any embedded monitoring feature. Once the shunt is installed, there is no way to measure the internal pressure outside of hospital settings. The proposed monitor enables a 'smart shunt' solution, which continuously records ICP information inside the shunt for many years. This data is read out wirelessly and can be used to prevent shunt failures and improve the treatment of this lifelong disease.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the commercial viability of technology that enables the real time measurement and control of landfill gas extraction systems. It has the potential to improve the economics of the Landfill Gas to Energy (LFG-E) market and reduce the environmental impact of landfills. With industry-wide implementation, annual revenues from existing LFG-E projects could be increased by over $450 million. The additional energy produced would power over 350,000 homes. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG), and the EPA estimates that in 2011, emissions from landfills accounted for nearly 17.5% of generation from all manmade sources in the US. The associated reduction in GHG emissions from improved landfill gas collection would be equivalent to the emissions of over 3.6 billion gallons of gasoline or 76 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, because of the improved economics, this Phase II project could encourage the development of new LFG-E projects, further expanding the size and value of this market. According to EPA estimates, currently undeveloped sites could account for an additional 850 MW of power generation, enough to power over 508,000 homes.

    The technical objectives of the project are 1) to reduce the cost of various system components, and 2) to address new product requirements related to third party safety and other certifications that are demanded by the market. The approach to cost reduction is to replace several commercially available off-the-shelf components (specifically, NDIR gas sensors and an electrically-actuated control valve) with custom designed alternatives that can meet product functional requirements at a 30% reduction in cost. In order to achieve the certifications that are demanded by the market it will be necessary to define the specific standards and protection concepts that are applicable, and then re-engineer hardware in accordance with these standards. This will involve a combination of component substitution and system re-design, depending on the specific protection concept(s) and hazardous location classification that are identified. The research will build upon the reliability and product functionality improvements that were a key outcome of the Phase I project, and successful completion of the research goals will enable more widespread adoption of real time control technology in the landfill gas industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the expedited development of a novel non-surgical medical device and therapeutic treatment for the approximately 1 in 3 women over the age of 30 who suffer from urinary incontinence, two thirds of whom, in part due to notable deficiencies of available solutions, elect to live without treatment while their symptoms progressively worsen. Urinary incontinence, although a very private concern, has far-reaching physical, psychological, social, and economic implications. For example, urinary incontinence has been found to reduce health-related quality of life measures on par with depression, incontinence is the number one reason for admittance into nursing homes, and the annual cost to the US healthcare system is estimated at $25 billion. Through design and validation activities this project will demonstrate the functionality of a wearable device that provides discreet, comfortable, easy-to-use therapy for female stress urinary incontinence. The technological understanding gained through this work lays the groundwork for subsequent commercialization of an FDA cleared product that will enhance the lives of tens of millions of American women.

    The proposed project provides a new framework for wearable therapeutics by enabling the patient to treat incontinence via discreet surface electrical stimulation without interruption to daily activity. Current non-surgical care often involves electrical stimulation via intravaginal probe, a treatment most woman are not willing to adopt or maintain. This project builds on successful Phase I feasibility work in which a contiguous array of cutaneous electrodes placed proximate the perineal tissue to deliver sufficient electrical muscle stimulation to promote pelvic floor toning were shown to maintain this efficacy under conditions associated with continuous wear.  The Phase II project goal is to develop an incontinence specific electrical muscle stimulator to function with the electrode array.  The system architecture will enable manipulation of the therapeutic waveform to support future multi-armed clinical studies designed to test the efficacy of various treatment regimens.  The system will also track treatment frequency, duration and intensity to provide information to clinical researchers.  Activity will include design, prototype fabrication, performance testing, human factors assessments, iteration and electrical safety validation.  Refinements to the electrode array are also anticipated.  The project will deliver a device suitable for future evaluation a human clinical studies, FDA clearance and product commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to help protect the environment by replacing existing toxic and environmentally-hazardous corrosion inhibitors used as lubricant additives with more eco-friendly alternatives. Release of lubricants (for example from loss during use, improper disposal of waste lubricants, accidental spillage, or off-shore drilling) has the potential to cause damage to the environment. Awareness of the toxic nature of current lubricant additives is a driver to develop new technologies for more environmentally friendly products. This project addresses the development of novel, environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitor lubricant additives. Besides the environmental benefits of the new technology, the lubricant industry  may also benefit by expansion into environmentally sensitive market sectors (for example, marine lubricants used on ships) through the use of safer and less toxic additives. The new products also utilize non-petroleum based raw materials from renewable and sustainable resources, thus reducing dependence on petroleum. Apart from being non-toxic and environmentally friendly, the proposed products are also expected to be more effective inhibitors as compared to the products currently used in the market.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to design and develop environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitors providing high performance while meeting the eco-toxicological requirements of environmentally acceptable lubricants (EAL), including bio-lubricants. The use of corrosion inhibitors in lubricants is essential to protect metal surfaces. Unfortunately, many commercial corrosion inhibitors present issues with aquatic toxicity, persistence in the environment, and/or bioaccumulation that render them unacceptable for use in EAL or bio-lubricants. Awareness of the eco- toxicological problems of current inhibitors and the implementation of new regulations mandating the use of EAL in certain applications (e.g. marine lubricants) has created an urgent need in the market to replace existing products and the opportunity to develop new technologies for corrosion inhibition. This proposal addresses the key steps involved in the product development of corrosion inhibitors for biolubricants; namely (a) molecular design optimization, (b) cost-effective process scale up, (c) preparation of pound scale of lead products in the laboratory set-up; as identified in Phase I, (c) assessment of eco-toxicological properties using industry standard OECD/ASTM test methods and structure activity relationship (SAR) calculations, and (d) product storage stability testing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a commercial implementation of holographic video microscopy, a fast, precise and flexible technology for measuring the properties of individual colloidal particles suspended in fluid media. This disruptive technology solves critical manufacturing problems across industries that work with colloidal dispersions.  Demonstrated applications include: 1) monitoring the growth of nanoparticle agglomerates in precision slurries used to polish semiconductor wafers where scratches due to slurry agglomerates are responsible for waste valued at $1 billion annually; 2) tracking concentrations of dangerous contaminants in wastewater streams; and 3) measuring the concentration of protein aggregates in biopharmaceuticals, a safety concern noted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this $250 billion industry.  Holographic video microscopy is unique among particle-characterization technologies in providing comprehensive information about the size, shape and composition of individual particles in real time and in situ. Having access to this wealth of data facilitates product development, creates new opportunities for process control and provides a new tool for quality assurance across a broad spectrum of industries enabling safer, less expensive products for consumers while providing cost savings to manufacturers.

    The technical objectives of this project are: 1) to optimize the design of the underlying holographic microscopy system without compromising the quality of results; 2) to enable quantitative concentration determination including corrections for perturbations introduced by flow dynamics; 3) to expand the domain of operation to characterize non-spherical particles and 4) to apply machine-learning algorithms for automated robust operation.  Using holographic video microscopy for commercial applications requires adaptation and innovation in the design of the prototype instrument that was used to demonstrate feasibility. Streamlining the optical train will require advanced modeling and the creation of new methods of correcting optical aberrations to enable ease of manufacture. Additional improvements in design will include advances in improving microfluidic flow control to generate accurate concentration determination, to adapt holographic analysis algorithms for characterizing the structure of aspheric particles, and to extend analytical capabilities for turbid fluids. Finally, innovative machine-learning using neural network algorithms demonstrated significant improvements for analytical robustness in Phase I and will be extended to a wider range of applications. The Phase II effort will enable holographic video microscopy of real-world samples with typical measurement times of a few minutes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes new ways to inform, educate, advertise or entertain through a technology called projection mapping. This technology uses commodity video projectors to augment the surfaces of ordinary objects; applications range from advertising, events, and entertainment, to educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, and simulation (e.g. military or employee training). Through multiple deployments at retail locations across the country, the company's prototypes have demonstrated that these applications will benefit not only the brands and companies that employ the technology, but also the end-users (students, consumers, etc), resulting in better engagement and faster learning when compared to achieving these same tasks through other media such as videos. Research performed during the Phase II project will allow the company to develop a scalable product and fulfill many deployments, bringing projection mapping to new markets. A free version of the company's software will also be available for non-commercial and academic use, enabling interdisciplinary research in fine arts and computer science. The R&D results generated from the research will be published and disseminated to the public.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a commercially viable and scalable projection mapping system. While projection mapping has a long academic history, this captivating medium still remains out of commercial reach. As learned from over 50 customer discovery interviews, retailers are shifting towards location-based experiences to increase customer engagement and sales. Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences. To address this need, the company will develop hardware and software systems to enable captivating and immersive projection mapping experiences. The core of this system is in software: the developed algorithms will robustly calibrate projection mapping systems comprising any number of projectors/cameras, automatically align projected content to the scene and perform color-correction when the display surfaces are non-white/textured. These algorithms will be validated through standard benchmarks, resulting in novel, state-of-the-art practices. Additionally, these methods will allow for reusable projection mapping content, a critical feature lacking in existing software, as well as cloud deployment and monitoring. New hardware configurations will also be developed to achieve new uses for projection mapping.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project affects one of the fastest-growing sectors of the US economy. E-commerce sales in 2015 accounted for 7.4% of total U.S. retail and are expected to rapidly rise. The potential for the commercial impact of general each-picking systems is high, as current manual labor methods are pain points for distribution centers; human picking is unpleasant, expensive and inefficient due to high absenteeism, high turnover and human error. The success of the proposed technology will also contribute to American competitiveness in the robotics industry. Of the top 20 distribution system integrators, only three are currently based in the U.S. Robotics is going to be the key driver of progress in this area, where each-picking, our core product capability, is a key component of future automated distribution systems. Beyond warehousing logistics, applications that our technology can benefit include: broad applications of industrial automation and manufacturing; military applications (e.g., IED disposal, where robots can perform tasks that are dangerous for humans to perform); and assistive healthcare (e.g., where robots must be compliant enough to be safe around humans while interacting successfully with unknown environments).

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on the development of a state-of-the-art each-picking robotic system and its deployment, initially targeted at the order fulfillment industry. To date, robotic systems have enabled significant progress on transporting inventory on shelves or in totes. However, there has not yet been a deployed system that can perform the task of picking individual items from inventory bins and placing them in boxes for shipment. During Phase I of this project, RightHand Robotics developed a picking system far in advance of the research literature on robotic grasping, picking tens of thousands of items previously unseen objects, with error rates of less than 0.1%. During Phase II, the project will focus on advancing the state of the art in data-driven refinement of grasp planning using machine learning techniques, and will develop methods for box-packing that exploit the company?s advanced compliant grippers. These improvements will result in an average pick-and-place time of 6 seconds or less and an undetected placement failure rate of fewer one in ten thousand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in line with the trend in medicine towards a prevention paradigm, following the premise that preventing problems is generally less costly than treating the problem or managing a future deficit. Excessive noise in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) has been clearly linked to cognitive deficits among the patients of these care areas. However, isolating the infants from any voice contact is also detrimental to language skill development. This project will investigate and develop a system that will provide for a more stable stay in the NICU, mitigate neurologic complications leading to developmental delays, and lessen the occurrence of hearing loss. The American Academy of Pediatrics? guidelines state that neonatal patients should not be exposed to noises greater than 45dBA yet hospitals struggle to achieve this. Deploying such a noise attenuation system with voice pass through capabilities will help hospitals provide the proper environment for their neonatal populations. Hospital administrators and clinical directors have expressed enthusiasm for this solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop an active noise reduction system for use in an NICU incubator, while allowing a parent's voice to pass through essentially unattenuated. To achieve the noise attenuation, the unwanted noise is monitored outside and inside the incubator and a corresponding signal exactly out of phase with the detected noise is used to largely cancel the unwanted noise. The system will employ a multi-channel hybrid system employing both feedback and feedforward elements. While a more complex approach, this has been shown to have performance advantages over simpler solutions. In this phase, the size of the zone of attenuation will be expanded, the algorithm will be adapted to multiple incubators having differing shapes, and a set of fail-safe provisions will be implemented.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its potential to revolutionize human-machine interfaces, with possible applications in computer-aided design (CAD); military, maintenance, and pilot training interfaces; industrial and construction operator interfaces; robotic and laparoscopic surgery; physical therapy, rehabilitation, and swing training; education; telerobotics; automotive navigation and safety systems; and video games. While haptic interactions in these applications can already be portrayed with desktop robotic force feedback devices, the developed haptic technology could provide realistic haptic feedback at a much lower price point (required for consumer devices) and unlike current force feedback devices, the developed haptic devices can be used to naturally interact in large workspace applications like motion-input video games or VR experiences. The proposed research will enhance the scientific understanding of human-haptic and multi-modal interactions in virtual environments, and will create a model for this technology to migrate into adjacent fields.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies in the emerging field of consumer virtual reality (VR). Multiple companies are now making inexpensive 3D head-mounted displays (HMDs) for VR, but current haptic interfaces are either too expensive, have limited range of motion, or are too crude to portray realistic haptic interactions in VR. The company has created an ungrounded haptic motion controller that utilizes a new form of touch feedback that applies in-hand shear forces to create compelling physical feedback at a price that is viable for consumer markets. The proposed research objectives are based on feedback from key stakeholders and VR enthusiasts who have tried the company?s current high-end haptic controllers. Their feedback suggests improving the overall user experience of the controllers through reducing device size, mass, and system latency, while improving device ergonomics and reducing cost. The Phase II research builds on the findings of Phase I, which showed that even simpler implementations of the newly developed haptic technology were still found to be more compelling than traditional vibration feedback. The project will result in a reference design that can be mass produced.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to bring a disruptive neutron detector technology to market, filling an urgent demonstrated need for real time, portable and wearable radiation detectors. Successful commercialization of the innovative Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) technology will serve a broad customer base in the nuclear detection and verification industry. Market research indicates large scale potential, in the billions of dollars. This market is currently well served with gamma ray and x-ray detection devices, but the capabilities for portable and wearable neutron detectors are not as well established. The proposed technology will close this gap and is anticipated to have a very broad impact. The Cerenkov detector technology can also be transformative in enabling new kinds of directional arrays for neutron imaging and portal detectors, helping to make the nation's borders more secure against illicit nuclear materials and providing improved tools for nuclear safeguards and verification.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize an innovative neutron detector module based 100% on solid-state technology. The overall objective of the project is to build on the successful Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) detector prototyping in Phase I/IB to develop a small, low cost, modular neutron detector which can be integrated with existing gamma detector technologies to 1) form a comprehensive, scalable, networked solution to the problem of Special Nuclear Material detection; 2) enable inexpensive in-house and third party integration of neutron detection technology into radioisotope identification devices and personal radiation dosimeters; and 3) allow for  further testing and advanced product development relating to directional neutron detector networks, direct fast neutron detectors, and neutron spectroscopy. The research objectives include a thorough quantitative assessment of the detector front-end material response to neutron radiation and evaluation of its optoelectronic characteristics. In particular, in collaboration with a specialty glass manufacturer, the isotopic composition of glass front-end will be optimized for fast neutron detection. The anticipated result is a novel and disruptive neutron detection approach.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in the field of healthcare.  The United States spends approximately $9,000 per person per year on healthcare.  Ultrasound medical imaging is a medical imaging technology that could lower costs by providing an alternative to higher-cost imaging techniques.  The technology created during this Phase II project is expected to increase the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound, which would in turn reduce medical imaging costs in the US healthcare system.  Furthermore, the company's technology is expected to bring ultrasound to more clinical settings and improve system-wide efficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  The technology also has commercial potential in the international market, with $5.8B spent annually on medical ultrasound devices worldwide.  Finally, by improving the utility of ultrasound, the technology will lead to improved patient care and may ultimately save lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop deep learning technology for ultrasound imaging in medicine.  Ultrasound imaging has numerous benefits including real-time image acquisition, non-invasive scanning, low-cost devices, and no known side-effects (it is non-ionizing).  However, variability in quality has encumbered its adoption and utility.  As a result, more expensive imaging is typically utilized, often exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Our objective is to develop, improve, and test machine learning techniques, based on deep learning, to improve ultrasound acquisition and interpretation.  We expect this project will create novel technologies that make ultrasound easier to use and improve the quality of ultrasound examinations.  The end result will improve the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound examinations, will result in cost savings to the healthcare system, will produce improvements in patient care, and will support a sustainable business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve the performance of encased atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilevers, reduce their fabrication costs, and optimize their properties for next-generation scanned probe microscopy technologies.  Atomic force microscopy is a workhorse technique for providing nanometer-scale information of materials, but its performance is compromised by viscous damping when operated in fluid.  The encased cantilevers to be developed in this project significantly reduces damping, leading to high force sensitivity and performance which is identical to AFM imaging done in air.  This aids quantitative interpretation of data and simplifies instrument operation. Encased cantilevers are a drop-in replacement, permitting the transformation of existing instruments into cutting-edge tools simply by exchanging the probe.  The impacts of these products will be felt in fields from biology to clean energy to materials science.

    The first technical objective of this research is to create new cantilever geometries that push the performance of our devices to the theoretical limits. The Phase I research resulted in a novel low-cost technique to fabricate encased cantilevers, thanks to the development of specialized semi-automated processing and quality control tools. The next technical objective of Phase II research is to further reduce fabrication costs by improving yields, increasing batch size, and implementing more manufacturing automation. We expect to demonstrate low-cost processing methods in which many high quality probes are fabricated efficiently. The third technical objective is to optimize these devices for next-generation scanned probe technologies including quantitative nanomechanical mapping, high-speed imaging and promising novel techniques such as photo induced force microscopy.  At the end of the project period we will have optimized products specifically targeting these high growth applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology for the intracellular delivery of biomolecules directly into cells. This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to manufacture an advanced hybrid energy harvester that can enable broad deployment of wireless sensor networks. Self-sustainable uninterrupted low-cost power supply with small size is in urgent need for internet of things, portable electric devices, wireless sensor networks, infrastructure health monitoring, active control, and battleground soldier support. Scavenging ambient energy from environment to power these devices can eliminate the cost of replacing batteries, particularly in remote environment. The hybrid energy harvesters developed in this project will significantly improve the power output and response dynamic frequency, therefore provide sufficient power to many such devices. The high power density will also enable more frequent data acquisition and transmission of such sensor networks, and promote more ubiquitous deployment of advanced sensor networks. The automatic manufacturing process will enable their adoption by various customers including internet of things.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project will develop manufacturing processes for advanced hybrid energy harvesters. Although piezoelectric energy harvesters have found broad applications, their power density and mechanical-electrical conversion efficiency are still low, with values at microwatts to milliwatt and <10%, respectively since they primarily operate at the d31 mode of the piezoelectric transducer and the mechanical impedance mismatch between the vibration source and the harvesting device. The Phase I project successfully demonstrated that the advanced hybrid energy harvesting device can provide significantly higher power density at > 100 mW and conversion efficiency at > 40% by using the more efficient d33 piezoelectric mode and with reduced stiffness in a curved structure that can efficiently transfer the energy from the vibration source to the active piezoelectric materials. The Phase II project will be focused on developing low-cost innovative automatic manufacturing process to enable their practical applications in commercial and industrial market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will dramatically increase the efficiency of communications networks. Commercially, the ability to dynamically, adaptively and optimally route traffic on data networks will lead to network cost savings ranging from 60% - 70% for network service providers. Critically, the project leverages the recent industry shift towards software-defined networking (SDN) that is projected to become a $45 billion market by 2020. The excitement behind SDN is driven primarily by the promised performance benefits of better traffic control. By bringing to market its provably optimal, dynamic and adaptive traffic control algorithms, the company will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity. The immediate resulting social impact will be that end users will have access to faster, cheaper and more robust data networks. In the longer term, efficient software control of networks will enable rapid innovation in networking leading to new network applications that have not even been envisioned yet. The project also enhances technological and scientific understanding by commercially verifying the company's solution to a longstanding open problem in networking - namely, whether an easy to deploy, dynamic, adaptive and optimal routing algorithm can be found.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on delivering commercial, smart, traffic control algorithms that can unlock the full capacity of modern communications networks. Today, due to unprecedented traffic growth, network operators face major challenges in the form of efficient resource utilization. The problem is that the inherent randomness of data traffic has led to network designers over-provisioning networks to the point where they run at 30% - 40% utilization on average. The company's competitive advantage is a new algorithm that allows it to optimally manage traffic variations by adjusting network routes in real time while retaining the scalability and simplicity of today's protocols. The goal in this project is to build on the beta tests from Phase I by developing an enterprise-grade, cloud-based network control application that is ready for general market launch. To this end, the company will start with small commercial deployments at selected test partners. Feedback from these deployments will be used to iron out any issues before general market launch. By the end of the project, the company anticipates generating significant revenue from initial customers as it continues to innovate and maintain its current lead in developing SDN control plane software.

    potential of this project is to create sustainable, high&#8208;performance nanocomposites.
    Expected weight savings is between 13 and 20% per component. Corporate Average
    Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations require significant increases in fuel economy
    for vehicles, which has led carmakers to look for innovative ways to shed vehicle
    weight. It has been shown that for every 10% in weight savings, vehicle fuel consumption
    is reduced by 7%. The target application is to replace heavy glass reinforcement
    in polymeric composites with CNCs for car parts, providing lighter weight vehicles

    resulted in significant reductions in cost (with more reductions expected), making
    CNs an increasingly attractive functional natural nanofiller, the processing of

    Furthermore, the company will improve performance of these materials in order
    to attain performance parity with higher&#8208;loaded glass&#8208;reinforced parts
    and potentially to compete with ultra&#8208;high performance materials such as

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in increasing the comfort of people, such as athletes during their high intensity workouts and competitions, warehouse workers who require protective clothing in hot and humid environments, and safety (e.g. firemen and first responders) and military personnel who must endure extreme working conditions.  Our revolutionary moisture management technology utilizes a novel 3D microfluidic transport principle to move sweat from the skin to the outside of clothing, where it can drip away or be controlled. Compared with conventional moisture wicking products which are based on capillary absorption, our technology allows fabric and apparel products to remain lightweight, always dry, highly breathable and never-saturated.  ATACAMA?s technology is designed to provide the wearer an improved regulation of body temperature and comfort level during high intensity activities, contributing to both performance and safety.


     This project aims at solving the current problems of moisture-management products that are inadequate when dealing with large amount of moisture (e.g. sweat). In high sweat or high heat situations, apparel can become quickly saturated with moisture, leading to a wet, heavy, sticky feeling that impacts the performance of the wearer. Our proposed research aims to develop a broad range of textiles that can continuously transport moisture, so that fabric remain dry, breathable and lightweight during high intensity physical activities in hot and humid environment. Utilizing the large-scale manufacturing process developed in Phase I, ongoing research efforts will focus on the implementation of the technology on a broad range of fabric materials (e.g. polyester/polyurethane blends, cotton). As well, scientists at ATACAMA will optimize designs of the fluidic channels based on body sweat mapping research and will further enhance the robustness of the fluidic network. A series of breakthrough textile products (e.g. fabrics and apparel) integrated with optimized and robust 3D microfluidic-enabled moisture management technology will result from the completion of Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project promises to deliver a convenient, sustainable, cost effective, and environmentally friendly bait for crustacean fishermen, worldwide.  The  patent- pending innovation offers a formulated, synthetic product that mimics scent cues released from traditional fish bait, while offsetting unwarranted ecological impacts of current practices. Specifically, scent cues can be released at variable rates to provide optimal results in addressing fishing methods and preferences in different conditions and regions. Given rising costs of fish due to competition with omega-3 supplements producers, as well as labor and frozen storage costs of obtaining wild bait, and vessel space needed for such bait when fishing, the new bait will save fishermen time, money, and inconvenience. Commercially, cost advantages are likely to generate significant demand in addition to the overall practical advantages. From a societal perspective, a   sustainable,   synthetic product   can   dramatically   reduce "net fishing" for baiting crustacean  traps. Thus, fish could  be   conserved   in the oceanic food chain, and indiscriminate killing of sea turtles, dolphins and other by- catch would be diminished through reduced net fishing practices now employed in the capture of small wild fish traditionally used for crustacean bait.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are: to optimize solubility kinetics of the attractant-releasing matrix; further characterize naturally occurring molecules released by traditional bait fish; and validate product performance to catch indigenous crustacean species in the United States. Field research would focus on concentrations of chemo-attractants required to optimize  manufacturing  formulation  and  direct costs. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity will be the characterization of the chemical basis for cues emitted by piscine, avian and mammalian tissue that most intensely attract crustacean species while developing a range of matrix formulations for optimally releasing such attractants in various fishing conditions. In addition to globally urgent considerations  of  by-catch  and  wild  stock  depletion, the  industry has been struggling with bait sustainability issues. These challenges have intensified with federal and state agencies seeking court orders to regulate catch limits, resulting in reduced supply and higher prices of bait fish. These circumstances frame an ecological and commercial opportunity for this synthetic bait alternative. Reducing the need to capture wild bait fish, as well as delivering cost and logistical advantages to commercial crustacean fisheries are expected to drive rapid market penetration upon completion of product research and development in this Phase II project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable the availability of a revolutionary manufacturing process for pharmaceuticals. The project consists of the development of novel process technologies, as well as the integration of these processes into an end-to-end continuous manufacturing line that can produce drugs continuously (24/7 basis). This is different from the current methodology that produces large quantities of drugs at discrete time points (e.g. large batch quantities are produced several times a year).  A working pilot plant of this process demonstrated significant operational advantages with a marketed drug-production time was reduced from 200 days to 2 days, plant footprint decreased by 90%, projected costs reduced by 50%, while improving product quality.  The impact on society will be considerable: patients will receive better quality drugs; drug shortages will be greatly reduced; and pharmaceutical companies will be able to manufacture and distribute their drugs in a much more cost-effective and efficient manner, allowing them to reallocate more capital to Research and Development (new drugs developed).  Finally, it will be possible to relocate manufacturing plants and jobs back in the U.S. (more efficient processes = lower costs).

    The proposed project builds upon a successful Phase I SBIR project, as well as five years of collaboration between a premier research institution and a leading pharmaceutical company aimed at developing a novel continuous manufacturing process to overcome the limitations of the current standard, batch manufacturing.  The first objective of this NSF project is to further develop two novel elements of a multistep, continuous manufacturing process (i.e. heterogeneous crystallization and electrospinning for solid dosage forms), so they run reliably under different operating conditions. This is important because commercial production requires that they perform consistently and reliably 24/7. Thus, these novel unit operations will be studied under different operating conditions and starting materials, while their design is optimized.  Success will be defined when the unit operations achieve: 1) maximal operational efficiency, 2) industry standard manufacturing capabilities, and 3) qualification to be used across the Research and Development manufacturing spectrum.  The second objective is to integrate these two units into a broader end-to-end continuous manufacturing process capable of producing high-quality pharmaceuticals on a continuous basis. The integrated process will also feature three unit operations on separation, filtration and drying that were developed during Phase I of this SBIR project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for a more effective glaucoma treatment by adjusting eye pressure based on disease progression for each patient. In 2015, the US glaucoma market is estimated to be over $2 billion and our addressable market, glaucoma surgical therapies, is estimated to be $534M. The incidence for glaucoma increases with age, and as the baby boomer population gets older, there will be a growing need for glaucoma treatments. To treat glaucoma, patients undergo lifelong drug regimens, multiple laser procedures, and invasive surgical procedures. However, even with all these treatment options glaucoma patients still go blind from glaucoma. The proposed novel design and approach to glaucoma will personalize the treatment for patients and remove the need for numerous and costly procedures. Most importantly, the personalization of glaucoma therapy will optimize visual protection for every patient.

    The proposed project will validate the safety and efficacy of a glaucoma drainage device to adjust and set pressure in the eye. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and is only treatable by reducing eye pressure. Surgical treatments are unpredictable with suboptimal success rates based primarily on the choice of drainage site. The proposed novel device drains to a new area of the eye to avoid the complications and unpredictability associated with the current glaucoma surgeries. The device also can provide the first-ever personalized treatment for millions of glaucoma sufferers by fine-tuning pressure based on the needs of the patient throughout his or her lifetime. Phase I/IB studies have shown feasibility of the device with an adjustable component.  However, its efficacy and safety have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, in this Phase II research grant, we will optimize the device for safety and efficacy and perform the necessary preclinical testing according to FDA standards to further develop the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a new analytical chemistry instrument for rapid quantitation of residual chemical impurities in complex mixtures. The target application for this project is the detection of genotoxic impurities during early drug development in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The instrument to be developed uses Fourier transform molecular rotational resonance (FT-MRR) spectroscopy to identify molecules based on their three dimensional geometry, which permits high chemical specificity.  FT-MRR is a high-resolution spectroscopy technique that makes it possible to directly analyze gas mixtures containing a large number of chemicals without the need for prior chemical separation using chromatography - a time-consuming step of current analysis methods that requires significant technical supervision.  As a result, FT-MRR based chemical analysis instruments have the potential to speed up innovation for pharmaceutical manufacturers by reducing analytical development cycles from weeks to hours during the high-throughput drug innovation process.  Chemical analysis instruments using FT-MRR spectroscopy enable faster innovation in research and development labs with the added benefit of seamless method transferability to on-line process monitoring applications and routine quality control for final product release.

    The ability to transfer analysis methods into routine analysis is important to the industry goal of continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals.  It is enabled for FT-MRR in part (yet critically) by the two main objectives of this Phase II effort: the development of sampling automation for FT-MRR and the design of a cost-reduced, targeted FT-MRR system.  Concepts for both of these designs were successfully tested during Phase I.  The intellectual merit of this project is the introduction of a new technique for chemical analysis that senses chemicals based on the absolute molecular structure, with no orthogonal analysis required.  FT-MRR spectral fingerprints can distinguish molecular isomers, conformers, isotopologues, and even enantiomers.  With this kind of absolute structure information, FT-MRR can enable new studies that trace chemical pathways with site-specific isotopic ratio information and chiral detection.  Both concepts are otherwise very challenging with current technology.  The FT-MRR instrument to be built for this project combines recent advances in high-power, solid-state millimeter wave (mm-wave) light sources, low-cost microwave synthesizer integrated circuits, and high-speed digital electronics to implement a time-domain, Fourier transform (FT) measurement approach.  Standard methods for chemical sampling will be integrated to maximize the ease-of-use and robustness of FT-MRR instruments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project is to demonstrate a low cost, environmentally friendly co-extrusion fabrication method for producing high surface area micro- and nanofiber based nonwoven fuel filter sheets.  The micro-/nanofiber nonwoven structures are fabricated from two different hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers in a melt co-extrusion and subsequent exfoliation processing step.  The resulting porous filtration media sheets have been shown to possess superior strength, tailorable pore sizes, and fuel filtration efficiency on par with currently utilized commercial fuel filter products.  These accomplishments signify a path forward to a highly scalable manufacturing process for producing low cost thermoplastic filter products in addressing the increasingly stringent EPA regulation of ppm level water contaminant. The reduced manufacturing process complexity in melt co-extrusion is estimated to provide up to 60% reduced production costs when scaled to commercial production quantities. Additionally, a significant environmental impact will be realized through adoption of this novel production technology over competitive processes owing to its ?greener? solvent-free manufacturing aspects that eliminates the annual need for millions of gallons of organic solvents and supporting reclamation equipment currently utilized by the filtration industry in creating elctrospun and wet-laid composite nonwoven filtration media.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to fabricate nano/micro scale nonwoven fibrous filter mats for fuel filters via a novel melt co-extrusion approach, with high fuel/water filtration efficiency and superior mechanical properties, in a commercially relevant production scale, towards addressing the stringent EPA 2010 filtration regulations and its upcoming revisions in 2015. The first generation filter prototypes fabricated in Phase I STTR program exhibited up to a ten-fold increase in surface area, up to a two-fold increase in porosity and up to a six-fold the deformation strength of the commercial filters. The coextruded microporous filter fiber size distribution was comparable to a commercial melt-blown process sample and superior to the leading wet-laid technology samples. Preliminary filtration efficiency experiments on the coextruded micro-fiber filtration media prototypes exhibited 60 to greater than 80 % separation of water from ultra-low sulfur diesel as compared to 80 % water separation using commercial filter under same testing conditions. The commercial interest for the new multilayered, coextruded filtration media processing technique is centered on identification of new filtration media film polymer materials, achieving nano-sized pore distributions for improved filtration efficiency and achieving scale-up production cost savings through the improved filter film processing technique.

    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project proposes a novel
    approach to treating fire blight, a pathogenic disease affecting pome fruits caused
    by E. amylovora, and tomato canker caused by C. michiganensis. Both pathogens
    form biofilms connected to their virulence in plants. There is currently no treatment
    although the incidence of reoccurring infections by E. amylovora and C. michiganensis
    contribute to millions of dollars of losses in fruit production. Antibiotics and
    disinfectants typically kill only growing cells. This approach consumes growing,
    dormant, or biofilm-enmeshed bacteria. Inclusion of biofilms as targets will help
    to identify a means to solve some of the most intractable infections known. The
    research objectives of this Phase II SBIR proposal are to: 1) Screen Dictyostelid
    (Dicty) isolates in vitro for biocontrol capabilities for orchards and decontamination
    of plants/equipment, 2) test efficacy of Dicty candidates en planta, and 3) design
    methods for spore production and packaging. For commercial applications, the goal
    is to use probiotic bacteria to amplify Dicty and produce spores. For spore preservation
    and dispersal, the plan is to use methods proven to be successful and safe for
    other biocides.  Natural biocides products will be developed for agricultural
    research and to treat pathogenic outbreaks in fruit and vegetable crops."

    The broader/commercial impact of the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be a cell sorter, a new research tool for life science research, animal reproduction, and cell-based therapy.  In the past decade, cell sorters have become vital in many fields, such as molecular and cellular biology, immunology, plant biology, animal reproduction, and medical diagnostics and therapeutics.  Despite their significant impact, current cell sorters have the following drawbacks: high equipment and maintenance costs, significant bio-safety concerns, and reduced cell viability and function. These drawbacks reduce the effectiveness of cell sorters in many important research studies and clinical applications. Enabled by this innovation, researchers will be able to better understand the causes of diseases, identify new therapies, and test new drugs and vaccines.  It also has the potential to improve dairy production efficiency, and aid medical doctors in making better decisions about diagnosis and treatment. In Phase II, the goal is to improve performance of the instrument, and validate the performance with end users.

    This STTR Phase II project will demonstrate the feasibility of a microfluidic-based, bio-compatible, bio-safe, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Cell sorters are powerful, high-throughput, single-cell characterization and purification tools that are vital for labs in fields such as molecular biology, pathology, plant biology, stem cell biology, and medical diagnostics.  The technology is based on acoustofluidic (i.e., the fusion of acoustics and microfluidics) cell sorting chips that preserve the integrity and functionality of sorted cells.  Current cell sorting systems reduce cell viability, integrity, and cell function due to high shear stress, high impact force, and high driving voltage, which reduces their effectiveness as a research tool, and in clinical applications.  Unlike current cell sorters that use electrostatic force to sort cells, which require 12,000 V of driving voltage, the proposed technology uses acoustic tweezers to sort cells, and requires only 10 V, which significantly reduces cell damage.  Compared with existing cell sorters, the proposed microfluidic cell sorter will have the following advantages: 1) high bio-compatibility; 2) high bio-safety; and 3) lower costs and lower maintenance. In addition, the cell sorter will be more accessible to researchers and address existing unmet needs in the market (e.g., sorting fragile or sensitive cells while preserving high viability and function). This will accelerate research findings and improve diagnostics and therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address the need for alternative imaging technologies for women with mammographically dense breast tissue by significantly enhancing clinical breast ultrasound images. Mammography is the gold standard for breast cancer screening; however, both dense breast tissue and cancerous lesions appear white on a mammogram, making it difficult to reliably detect cancers. Women who have dense tissue - 26 million in the United States alone - need alternative imaging technologies for early stage cancer detection. Studies show that the addition of a single screening ultrasound increases cancer detection by 28% over mammography alone, with significantly higher combined diagnostic accuracy. Despite these findings, a fourfold increase in the false positive rate undermines ultrasound use by physicians in breast imaging. A technology that improves ultrasound image clarity in dense breast tissue would revolutionize breast cancer imaging by allowing physicians to noninvasively detect malignancies previously obscured by their size and/or poor contrast and distinguish them from benign lesions. There is the strong potential to save lives by substantially increasing the overall cancer detection rate while simultaneously reducing the number of false positives.


    The proposed project seeks to develop an adaptive beamforming technology that will significantly improve the clinical utility of ultrasound imaging. Unlike traditional beamforming, adaptive beamforming estimates the time delays between ultrasound probe elements and does not require prior knowledge of the speed of sound along the beam path to produce an image of the tissue. The more accurate time delays result in improved beam focusing and allow for larger transducer arrays, which in turn allows for deeper signal penetration - enhancing signal strength, spatial resolution, and image contrast. The preceding Phase I project used simulated ultrasound data to develop a novel adaptive beamforming technique with least-mean square filters that improves signal-to-noise ratio by up to 32 dB and image contrast by up to 38%. The Phase II project objectives are to acquire raw, radio-frequency ultrasound data from both representative breast phantoms and an in vivo study; to optimize and finalize the adaptive beamforming algorithm; to process the study data and evaluate improved image contrast and clinical benefit; to produce a software application embodying the adaptive beamforming technique; and to design the network architecture and data management approach required to deliver that software as a license or as a Software as a Service (SaaS) product to medical facilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of
    surgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and
    reduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000
    procedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of
    these surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into
    longer recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision
    surgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks,
    while the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as
    the revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are
    avoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has
    the potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image
    guidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally
    invasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a
    novel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during
    surgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than
    fluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with
    surgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical
    inaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated
    the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by
    showing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This
    Phase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a
    variety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III)
    confirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an
    ergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a
    system prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus
    fluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these
    objectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research,
    regulatory clearance and commercialization.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is making tough, 3D printed parts that can be
    directly manufactured through additive processes commercially available. Additive
    manufacturing has potential to revolutionize the way parts are produced by streamlining
    product design, production, and validation, which allows for low production costs
    and accelerated lead times. The penetration of additive technology into industrial
    processes has been greatly slowed by the current inability to 3D print parts of
    any stiffness with materials properties on par with traditionally manufactured
    parts. Particularly, 3D printed materials tend to tear or fracture more readily
    between successive printed layers. At Adaptive 3D Technologies, we have developed
    resins that produce tough, robust parts that are tougher than many current 3D
    printed products in the x, y and z planes by achieving covalent crosslinking across
    printed layers. These materials and processing techniques will help drive additive
    manufacturing into large volume, yet customizable, market sectors to increase
    efficiency and productivity across industries.  The printed parts resulting from
    our printable materials will further U.S. manufacturing by lowering production
    costs, increasing product performance and reshoring advanced manufacturing. \n\n\nThis
    project is focused on understanding interface chemistry and adhesion phenomena
    in a special class of low-viscosity, thiol-ene resins to produce a range of mechanically
    tough materials that are 3D printable via stereolithography (SLA). A significant
    problem with current SLA approaches is that successive printed layers do not adhere
    sufficiently together, leading to large reductions in toughness as measured by
    the stress-strain response in soft, viscoelastic and stiff materials. Our Phase
    II research explores the tradeoffs between molecular architecture, reactivity,
    resin viscosity, and key printing parameters to develop improved materials to
    enable tougher printed parts than industry standards along multiple axes of deformation
    at similar printing speeds and feature sizes well below 100 microns. We have developed
    a portfolio of 3D printable materials with room temperature Young's moduli near
    2 MPa, 20 MPa, 200 MPa or 2 GPa.  Soft and viscoelastic materials have strain
    capacities well above 100% in all print directions, including when measured perpendicular
    to print layer interfaces. We expect to further our polymers' thermomechanical
    properties through the proposed Phase II SBIR effort by incorporating proper additives
    into our systems to control color, shelf life, aesthetics, mechanical properties
    and compatibility with various jetting techniques."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a new Distal Locking Hemodialysis Catheter
    System that will be the first to provide clinicians with a tool to manage the
    most significant complications (infection, thrombosis, and loss of lock solution)
    associated with chronic hemodialysis catheter use. More than 430,000 Americans
    currently receive hemodialysis treatments, and this prevalence is expected to
    grow 3-5% each year. A significant portion of the $29 billion spent annually treating
    ESRD patients in the U.S. is dedicated to managing complications with vascular
    access ? many of which are associated with catheters. It typically costs between
    $2,000 and $40,000 per patient to treat a blood-borne infection, which translates
    to more than $3 billion each year in the U.S. There is a need for this product
    to allow physicians to confidently use whatever lock therapy is clinically best
    on a per-patient basis. The catheter system will enable for the development and
    FDA approval of new, non-antibiotic antimicrobial agents, which have been unable
    to gain/maintain approval due to concerns of leakage. The device has the potential
    to be a market leader in the $3 billion U.S. market for vascular access devices

    a Distal Locking Hemodialysis Catheter System. Over 400,000 Americans undergo
    hemodialysis annually. Common complications are catheter-related bloodstream infection,
    thrombosis and thrombotic occlusions, each of which can be fatal. The primary
    solution to these complications is the use of heparin and antimicrobial lock solutions.
    However, existing catheters present the possibility of accidental infusion of
    these highly concentrated solutions into the circulation during the locking procedure
    or during the locked period between uses of the catheter. These leakages increase
    the risk of toxicity, and FDA-approved anticoagulants that leak into the systemic
    circulation can cause minor or major bleeding. The catheter system being developed
    in this project will significantly decrease complications tied to the loss of
    lock solutions, such as life-threatening infections, toxicity and bleeding events.
    The research shall include refinement of the catheter?s design (material selection
    and mechanical tests); ensuring that manufacture of catheters is consistent; and
    additional testing in vivo. The project is expected to demonstrate that the catheter
    system is compatible with lock solutions, shows adequate flow rate, has sufficient

    designed specifically to address the need for pandemic stockpiling and surge capacity
    use. The output of this Phase will be a new ventilator ready for FDA clearance
    and market entry in 2017. US government planners have described a need for many
    thousands of additional ventilators in the event of a pandemic influenza or other
    large-scale medical emergency. Severe influenza often leads to respiratory distress
    which cannot be dealt with in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Given some
    time and a mechanical ventilator, the human body can often clear the infection
    on its own. Without help from the ventilator, patients may die. Manufacturers
    of current ventilators have attempted to reconfigure their existing offerings
    to meet the stockpiling demand. Unfortunately none of these devices are able to
    match the price/performance ratio needed to make stockpiling in large numbers
    economically feasible. Building upon an innovative platform for mechanical ventilation

    United States, the number of patients in need of mechanical ventilation has been
    estimated to be over 700,000. Of these, the most severe cases are often in the
    very old and the very young.  There are currently 62,274 ventilators in use in

    the clinical need and all product requirements. We will then design, build, and
    test a series of prototype concepts using sophisticated software modeling, benchtop
    test platforms including mechanical and electronic lung simulation, and real-world
    user feedback. In the second Aim the company will address manufacturing and supply
    chain requirements, integrate design for manufacturing, and build and test a final
    series of near-production prototypes. These late-stage test procedures will include
    clinical performance and accuracy in accordance with regulatory standards, electromagnetic

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to open price-sensitive research, medical imaging and surveillance communities to the benefits of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) waveband without the complexity or expense of traditional hyperspectral systems. The multispectral SWIR imager developed in this project supports medical microscope and small animal imaging of infrared fluorescence for cancer detection, localization and excision.  SWIR fluorophores produce no autofluorescence background while simultaneously enhancing tissue penetration depth and efficiency by factors of 10 or more. InView?s imaging platform can build large markets by the development of specialized image processing and analytical methods for specific applications in pharmaceutical manufacturing, food safety, solar panel and semiconductor inspection, machine vision, and navigation.  InView?s camera platform embodies the revolutionary new sampling theory of compressive sensing, a field whose applications in information processing have grown exponentially.  The innovative architecture and the state-of-the-art software already embedded in the camera and user interface can enhance and possibly transform lab and clinical modalities in dynamic multi-fluorescence imaging, in vivo functional imaging, tissue viability and pathology studies, and advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will result in an operational low-cost, multi-color shortwave infrared (SWIR) camera that can be directly mounted on microscopes for supporting compelling micro-imaging applications in scientific, industrial and biomedical imaging.  The electro-optical, opto-mechanical, and processing software architecture of the camera is based on Compressive Sensing, a new sampling technique that reduces data collection requirements for high resolution imaging to well below Nyquist limits. This design does not use expensive sensor arrays or complicated spectrometers.  Instead, high-resolution pictures are computationally constructed from single-detector measurements. The ?single-pixel camera? architecture was commercialized by InView as a monochromatic SWIR imager.  In Phase 1, InView successfully demonstrated that only simple modifications to its  monochromatic camera design can produce full color imaging. The objective of Phase 2 is to modify only the components that are necessary to transform the existing monochromatic camera into a multi-color imager with the overall design goal of maintaining the existing camera size, weight and cost so that InView can offer low-cost multispectral SWIR imaging to the price sensitive microscopy community.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the development  of a new class of graphical-media-design system that lies between today's 2D digital paint systems and 3D computer-aided design systems. This technology will allow architects, engineers, artists, and school children to create compelling 3D experiences directly from their drawings without extensive training. Furthermore, it will accelerate the creation of interactive 3D content and significantly reduce the time, cost and expertise currently required to create it. By bridging the gap between traditional drawings and 3D modeling, this project will provide the unique ability to reuse and "reproject" drawn strokes, thus enabling the creation of expressive 3D drawings with minimal effort. The technology developed in this project will help lower the barrier and generate new business opportunities in content creation for electronic publishing and for other creative professionals, such as architects, designers, and ad-agency art directors. Finally, this project includes specific outreach activities, through collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History, that will provide unique educational services to the local community, while simultaneously introducing this new technology to the world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on making the creation of this new type of graphical media as intuitive and fluid as paper and pencil. This Phase II project will support system improvements - including user-interface improvements - to simplify 3D navigation for the consumers of this media. This will be needed for using this media in digital children's picture books, which have already been identified as early adopters of this technology as well as an important market. Another technical objective will be to develop a hybrid vector-raster representation, which will provide a wider range of artistic expression, while improving rendering performance of large scenes. A third objective is to develop stroke deformation algorithms to support direct manipulation of objects and characters to provide sketch-driven animation capabilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an ultra-light, modular wind turbine for use in buoyant airborne wind energy systems. Reduced turbine weight has a cascading effect on total airborne system mass, allowing a significantly smaller, lower cost buoyant structure to be used to access high altitude winds. At heights up to 2,000 feet winds are strong and consistent, allowing for the production of low-cost, reliable power at a broad array of sites. High altitude winds have over five times the energy potential of ground winds accessed by tower-mounted turbines, opening the potential for a major new renewable energy resource to be harnessed. In addition, the containerized deployment of airborne wind turbines has the potential to expand wind development to sites that are not feasible today, including sites that are remote or have weak ground-level winds. Overall, the technology holds the potential to significantly lower energy costs and improve reliability for remote industrial, community, and military customers and represents a major step forward in unlocking the abundant high-altitude wind resource to help in the global pursuit of greater adoption of renewable energy sources.

    This SBIR Phase II project will focus on reducing the total weight of the wind turbine system.  Turbine weight is one of the most critical cost drivers of buoyant airborne wind energy systems. For each kilogram removed from the turbine, an additional kilogram can be removed from the inflatable shell and tethers, resulting in a significantly smaller and lower cost system. The lightest commercially available small- to medium-sized wind turbine weighs 31.1 kilograms per kilowatt of capacity, which is too heavy for an economically-viable airborne turbine. By incorporating a compact, modular architecture, a lightweight permanent magnet direct-drive (PMDD) generator and high-strength composite materials, the proposed Phase II research effort aims to double the power density of traditional medium size turbines, making the proposed system suitable for use in an airborne application, while maintaining a high level of reliability and cost performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of an innovative cyber security solution based on Power Fingerprinting (PFP) for vulnerable wireless networking equipment and smart grid infrastructure. PFP can prevent well-funded adversaries from compromising these critical systems and operate without being discovered. The PFP monitor can assess the integrity directly on the target platforms, including those for which there is no commercial solution available. PFP can be applied to a variety of embedded platform and can coexist with traditional cyber security solutions adding an extra layer of protection in a defense-in-depth approach. These characteristics make PFP capable of detecting sophisticated attacks, such as the recent Stuxnet worm. Traditional peripheral cyber security approaches, such as anti-virus and firewalls, are being adapted for the target platforms but with limited success. PFP addresses a growing need to secure critical infrastructure, such as communications and power generation and distribution, and directly monitor their execution. PFP has dual application in the commercial and government cybersecurity markets, particularly for resource-constrained and embedded platforms. PFP has the potential to become a fundamental player in cyber-security by protecting the nation?s infrastructure and promoting further development of the economic base and employment.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to demonstrate a commercial prototype of a novel cyber security solution for wireless network infrastructure and Smart Grid applications based on a novel approach called Power Fingerprinting (PFP). PFP provides integrity assessment and intrusion detection for embedded and resource-constrained platforms by using an external device to monitor side-channel information and applying signal processing techniques to determine the execution status of a processor. Due to computational resource constraints, the application of traditional cyber security solutions to the proposed target applications is very limited. Furthermore, there are no commercial solutions available capable of directly monitoring the execution and detecting intrusions in networking equipment, such as wireless routers, or control systems used in the Smart Grid. The objectives of this Phase 2 effort include: 1) Demonstrate a PFP monitor commercial prototype for wireless network and Smart Grid platforms, 2) Leverage PFP tools to enhance automatic characterization on target platforms, and 3) Integrate suitable mechanisms to improve timing synchronization. At the end of Phase 2, a blind test demonstration of the prototype PFP monitor detecting malicious intrusions will be provided and serve as the launching pad into commercialization.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will eliminate remaining barriers to the production of bamboo fibers for use as a reinforcement in polymer composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be an increased usage of sustainable materials, increased revenue for US agriculture, and increased domestic and international sales of a new and innovative product line.  Success in this project will also lead to domestic job creation needed to support the research, manufacturing, and sales of these composites. The processes to be finalized during this Phase II project will support the growth of a nascent based on US-manufactured, environmentally-friendly products. Within three years of launch, it is expected that over $4 million in revenue will be generated by sales of bamboo fiber.  Moreover, increases in bamboo cultivation as a result of these new products will help mitigate adverse environmental impacts and improve public health. This will be done by the inherent sequestration of carbon dioxide in the plant growth cycle, and a reduction in the pollution associated with the use of high-energy glass fiber and plastics processing techniques.

    This Phase II project will address the following research topics:  species variations, manufacturability, additional high value products, additional composite properties, processing and treatment optimization, and commercial scale-up. The team will assess the mechanical and physical implications of variations in feedstock by the use of filament tensile testing. Surface treatments specific to bamboo fibers will be finalized, with the goal of increased fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion, mitigation of water absorption, and compatibility with at least three major resins systems.  These treatments will be evaluated via composite tensile testing, filament testing and water immersion testing.  Manufacturing studies will be performed to verify compatibility with commercial scale manufacturing equipment. The design and manufacture of a small scale, batch plant will address technological and automation challenges.  This plant will provide a bridge to a commercial-scale plant designed to produce 6 million pounds of fiber yearly.  Additional innovative aspects to the project lie in the assessment of a bamboo species compatible with climates in the US, automation of raw bamboo processing, and implementation of a fully optimized multi-step material functionalization process.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project represents
    a new development in man?s ability to keep birds away from the airspace surrounding
    an airplane or out of the way of the massive rotors of wind turbines. Animals
    respond to a bright ultraviolet light in the same way as humans respond to a bright
    flashlight in their eyes. If the light is strong enough, it causes an involuntary
    behavioral response resulting in the animal being deterred from the area of the
    light source. Ultraviolet light has the advantage of being visible to most species
    of animals while being invisible to humans. This Phase II project builds on the
    Phase I project that demonstrated with 98% confidence that bird behavior is influenced
    by the presence of the wildlife deterrence system?s bright ultraviolet light in
    a completely natural environment with no human presence. \n\n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is focused on three high value applications of the wildlife
    deterrence system. They are renewable alternative energy (wind farms), air transportation
    (planes and airports), and agriculture (aquaculture and agriculture). Renewable
    energy is at the top of the U.S. priority list. Wind energy is one of the most
    promising forms of alternative energy. At the same time, there is an immediate
    and pressing need to reduce the mortality rate of endangered and protected species
    at wind farms. A compelling global need for the wildlife deterrence system is
    exemplified by the aviation industry and the incidence of bird strikes. The U.S.
    Department of Transportation Inspector General reported in August 2012 that in
    the past two decades, wildlife strikes have increased from 1,770 reported in 1990
    to 9,840 reported in 2011, a greater than five-fold increase. Thirdly, although
    not at the level of importance as protection of aircraft and deterrence of birds
    from wind farm turbine rotors, worldwide seafood demand has grown annually by
    8.3 percent since 1970. This means that worldwide aquaculture production has rapidly
    expanded. Of particularly promising potential are solutions to the mussel farming
    problems of the international aquaculture industry which is well established in
    many parts of the world. All producing locations in North America and Europe share
    a common problem of severe predation loss from diving ducks such as the Common
    Eider that can be devastating to the mussel producer, with the potential to wipe
    out an entire crop (100%)."

    to enable the commercialization of a scalable bottom-up microwave synthesis process
    invented and demonstrated for obtaining bulk thermoelectric nanomaterials with
    25% higher figure-of-merit ZT at 50% cost savings than the state of the art. We
    anticipate the results of the project to expand the scope of, and transform, high
    efficiency thermoelectric refrigeration and waste-heat harvesting technologies.
    In particular, this project aims to transmute our synthesis approach to a manufacturing
    technology that consistently yields ton-scale nanothermoelectrics with ZT>1. The
    objectives are to 1) Complete the design of, and implement a microwave manufacturing
    platform with a 10 tons/year capacity, 2) Develop protocols for industrial-scale
    wafer production from the nanomaterials for device fabrication, and 3) Devise
    methods to further increase ZT through process optimization. The knowhow generated
    from the demonstration of kilogram-scale production shown in Phase I provides
    the foundation for the Phase II effort. We will focus on the widely used bismuth
    and antimony tellurides, and their alloys. We will strive to maximize process
    flexibility to facilitate greater ZT gains through process optimization and to
    facilitate the adaptation of our process technology to other thermoelectric nanomaterials
    for refrigeration and waste-heat harvesting.\n\n\tThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project will be to unlock and access the multi-billion dollar
    potential of thermoelectrics for transforming solid-state cooling. Thermoelectric
    materials already support a ~$1B/year industry, but has promise to be multi-fold
    higher if the conversion efficiency is increased just two-fold by using nanomaterials.
    The project will scale-up a nanomaterials manufacturing technology targeted to
    create new high efficiency solid-state cooling devices that can replace the current
    refrigeration and air-conditioning technologies based on environmentally unfriendly
    gases, and create high-efficiency electricity generators from waste heat, significantly
    expanding the thermoelectric markets and impacting global energy usage and addressing
    global environmental concerns. The work performed in the project will result in
    low-cost high-value thermoelectric nanomaterials manufacturing to replace extant
    energy-intensive methods that cannot cost-effectively produce high-efficiency
    materials. This will lead to introduction of a new class of nanomaterials with
    superior properties than that available currently in the marketplace. The work
    will expand the scope of thermoelectric device applications, paving the way for
    power generation technologies through implementation of our manufacturing method
    for other materials systems. The project is anticipated to create 10-25 jobs in
    3-5 years besides making New York State a global player in thermoelectrics innovation
    and nanomaterials manufacturing."

    bulky, and expensive. In the Phase I project, we demonstrated feasibility of the
    technology with a handheld ultrasound prototype, which demonstrated 3D freehand
    bone imaging using an ex vivo whole pig lumbar spine model. Phase II research
    objectives include: 1) Design and build a preproduction ultrasound prototype;
    2) Develop a model registration-based 3D bone imaging application and release
    a clinical software version with formal verification and validation testing; and
    3) Prepare the device for clinical use with human subjects and experimentally
    validate in an ex vivo porcine lumbar spine model with physician testing. It is
    anticipated that this project will result in the demonstration of a new medical
    device with demonstrated efficacy for improved administration of spinal anesthesia

    currently exhibit high first-attempt failure rates. Failures result in poor patient
    outcomes and higher costs for health care providers. In this application, our

    of spinal injections at the patient?s bedside. The societal impact of a safe,
    inexpensive, portable bone imaging products includes more successful procedures,
    better patient outcomes, and lower healthcare costs. Additionally, the public
    would benefit by an overall reduction in ionizing radiation exposure from X-ray
    and a subsequent reduction in cancers. The general scientific and technological
    understanding of acoustics will be enhanced through this project by a better understanding
    of ultrasound interactions with specular reflecting surfaces, such as bone."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables an innovative high-productivity approach to manufacturing hard and brittle materials like ceramics, semiconductors, and glass. The objective of this proposal is to build on the successful Phase I feasibility study to demonstrate an efficient and productive method that could manufacture ceramic and semiconductors with excellent part quality. The process, termed Micro-Laser Assisted Machining (micro-LAM), allows a cheaper (~40-60%), faster (by two to five times), and better method of machining and manufacturing hard and brittle materials by combining the preferential heat from a laser source and extreme pressure from a diamond tool. The status quo technology for manufacturing these materials requires extensive machining hours to obtain good part quality, which is not economical. The demand for high-end ceramics and semiconductors is continuously increasing; however, high production costs have forced manufacturers to use other materials with inferior properties.  The goal of this effort is to address this unmet need by commercializing the micro-LAM technology by the end of Phase II. A minimum viable product will be tested at industrial partner sites to obtain firsthand customer feedback, which is key to accelerating the commercialization process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt in semiconductor (microelectronics) manufacturing, optics (mirrors and windows), and precision mechanical products (bearing and seals), where the superior properties of advanced semiconductor and engineered ceramic materials are required to achieve performance criteria. This technology will enable entirely new capabilities for production of materials and products currently not viable or achievable due to processing limitations. The micro-LAM technology also has potential applications for emerging technologies, such as wind turbines and plug-in electric vehicles, where high-power and high-temperature operation of advanced devices is required. The current target market size, including optics, semiconductor, advanced ceramics and glass parts manufacturing, is approximately $250 million, with a 15%/year growth rate. Once market acceptance is established in the target market segment, the micro-LAM tooling will be launched into the larger diamond turning machine (DTM) market, with a total size of $2.4 billion.  There are approximately 10,000 DTMs in the United States alone (with ~ 500 new tools introduced per year).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a software platform for the engineering of living systems. Specifically, it will complete a software ecosystem that builds upon a core set of computational tools for the specification, design, build, test, analyze, and archive activities in synthetic biology and couple them with a rich set of interfaces to expert services (e.g., DNA synthesis, data analysis). The proposed work involves the completion of state-of-the-art design approaches and algorithms and couples it with the ability to create customized, modular workflows based on genetic circuit design, metabolic pathway modification, and genome engineering. The proposed work advances computational approaches in synthetic biology as well as innovating in the way that software services are monetized with biotechnology companies. The anticipated result of this work is a commercial software package and associated service agreements that can be deployed to both large and small biotechnology companies fundamentally changing the way that synthetic biology designs are conceived, designed, and physically created.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a software platform where the goal is to combine bio-design automation (BDA) software with explicitly integrated access to expert services in a workflow-driven software ecosystem.  The creation of novel living systems using biotechnology to engineer new medicines, materials, and fuels is frequently an ad-hoc process involving long iteration cycles, wasted resources, and sub-optimal designs. The software will allow for the automated specification, design, fabrication, test, and archival of complete plans for the engineering of novel engineered biological systems. This software includes mechanisms for specifying biological "rules," DNA assembly strategies, and automated generation of robotic instructions.  In particular, this effort will focus on the creation of genetic circuits, engineered metabolic pathways, and genome engineering.  The approach provides tools representing state-of-the-art advances in BDA while introducing novel methods of interacting with a large, diverse set of expert service providers. Further, the approach will empower novice experimentalists while enabling expert computational engineers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug screening system that will accelerate drug discovery for several eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema.  This technology will fulfill unmet needs of small and large biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery for various eye diseases by reducing development cost, expediting preclinical research, and increasing the chances of clinical success.  From the socio-economic standpoint, this technology will result in the development of more effective ocular drugs that will decrease eye disease treatment cost. Furthermore, this model will facilitate more rapid development of technologies for the diagnosis of glaucoma and new surgical techniques in the management of this disease.  Overall, this screening system will accelerate the development of medications for eye diseases, enhancing the quality of life for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapeutics and additional ocular diseases.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the eye tissue responsible for this disease due to absence of clinically relevant testing platform that incorporates this particular eye tissue. Presently, animal or human cadaver eyes are used to study and test the effects of medications on such tissue, however, these preparations are cumbersome and expensive. The proposed work will be the first-of-its-kind to engineer physiologically-relevant 3D human eye tissues utilizing novel cell culture methods along with microfabrication techniques and a microfluidic system. These 3D tissues will facilitate the development of disease-relevant in vitro model systems for understanding not only glaucoma but also diabetic retinopathy and macular edema pathology. This tool will help increase the success rate of glaucoma and ocular vasculature-related medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to address a strong commercial and scientific need for operational synthesis of spatially consistent and temporally relevant historical and current high resolution satellite imagery for analytical purposes. The technology will contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge especially in the geospatial arena and to market spillovers. By dramatically simplifying access to accurate imagery for any time and place, this technology will provide companies, researchers, educators, students, and regular citizens with a valuable tool for visualizing and exploring our changing planet and will contribute to increasing public engagement with science and technology. Further, the analytical capabilities offered by the imagery have great potential in scientific applications thus contributing to partnerships between academia and industry and improving datasets for research and education. Finally, this technology will be valuable in operational settings at the large providers of commercial satellite imagery, to individual users, and enable a wide variety of new visualization, analysis, and data mining applications. The examples of commercial applications for the technology are virtual earth, insurance and reinsurance, agriculture, emergency, change detection.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will operationally synthesize accurate regional-to-global, high spatial / high temporal satellite imagery of the Earth. The technology will utilize advanced data fusion algorithms to combine various sources of imagery while preserving the best spatial and temporal attributes of the data sources. The complexity of accessing, processing, and analyzing various sources of satellite imagery creates a significant barrier to its use. Synthesis of regionally and globally continuous high spatial / high temporal resolution imagery is a challenge as in addition to inherent differences in spatial and temporal resolutions of the source data, the new models need to account for enormous data volumes and sparse coverage of high spatial resolution imagery. Existing techniques to handle these challenges have severe limitations which curtail their use outside of the research arena. The technology will overcome these limitations by implementing algorithms that are robust, automated, scalable, deliver accurate data, and are usable in operational settings. They will provide spatially consistent and temporally relevant imagery which will empower businesses with regional and global outreach to make better decisions with better data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the production of enhanced-nutrition soybeans that have high levels of protein for use in aquafeed. Meat and fish consumption is rapidly growing due to increased world population and affluence. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector. Small wild-caught fish are used for aquaculture feed. Wild-caught fish harvests have not changed in 25 years and overfishing small fish jeopardizes the marine ecosystem. Aquafeed producers are turning to soy-based protein to replace fishmeal but soy-based proteins lack taurine and are deficient in methionine, two important nutrients for fish. To meet fish nutritional requirements, producers supplement soy-based aquafeed with synthetic taurine and methionine. In addition to added costs, synthetic taurine and methionine are produced from hazardous substances, and synthetic taurine has been shown to contain arsenic. Successful development of enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would reduce the amount of supplemental nutrients required in aquafeed, a $2.2B global annual cost predicted for 2020, and could save aquafeed producers 20% of their additive feed costs. Enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would be an economical, healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and secure source of taurine and methionine for the rapidly growing aquaculture industry.

    This SBIR Phase II project will use a biotechnology approach to increase the essential nutrients in soybean seeds for use in aquafeed. Many aquafeed producers use plant-based protein, primarily from soybean, as a replacement for fishmeal. However, plants lack some nutrients required for normal fish growth and development. Taurine and methionine, two nutrients either lacking or limited in soybean, are supplemented to soy-based aquafeed, thus increasing feed-production costs. The goal of this project is to increase the levels of taurine and methionine produced in the seeds of a commercial-grade, high-protein soybean variety that has high feed digestibility. Molecular and biochemical methods will be used to identify soybean seeds with: (1) taurine and high methionine levels; (2) uncompromised quality and viability; (3) unaffected levels of other nutrients; (4) normal to higher-than-normal protein content; and (5) low levels of nondigestible compounds. The anticipated results are the production of soybean seeds with a minimum of 0.2% taurine (dry seed weight) and at least 50% more total methionine compared with control seeds.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new technology that combines advanced bioengineering with traditional chemical manufacturing. This hybrid approach will allow production of high value chemicals for the polymer industry using biomass at a lower price than current petrochemical based processes. This unique approach allows for the retrofit of existing ethanol fermentation facilities in rural areas with a bolt-on chemical upgrading unit to produce chemicals with far higher value than ethanol, improving the economics of operating these facilities and creating new jobs. The initial chemical product targeted by this project has an estimated $100M annual market and is used in manufacturing a variety of consumer products including specialty polyurethanes, inks, and UV degradable plastics which can be dramatically expanded to $1B by 2020 through cost reductions enabled by this new technology. Eventually, this approach combining existing fermentation facilities with a bolt-on chemical processing unit can be used to produce carbon-neutral fuels that are fully compatible with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel at price comparable to current petrochemical fuels. This project, while here focused on the higher value polymer market, will enable later development of cost competitive fuel production technology.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate at pilot scale a complete downstream process capable of manufacturing the target chemical from the intermediate platform molecule produced with fermentation. In upstream Visolis work, the key intermediate has been produced using fermentation facilities hosted at the Advanced Biofuels Process Demonstration Unit at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories and the National Renewable Research Laboratories (NREL) at pilot scale, and based on current performance metrics the intermediate can be manufactured at prices comparable to ethanol at commercial scale. The goals of this downstream project are to utilize the intermediate generated using a 9000L scale fermentation facility at NREL to demonstrate cost-effective production of the target product from this intermediate. The work includes construction of a pilot scale high pressure chemical reactor, production and testing of several catalysts for performance in producing the target molecule at different process conditions, optimization of the chemical production process, evaluation of the process and catalyst for long-term stability, purification of the products to the levels required by customers, and technoeconomic modeling to inform the design of a commercial facility.

- abstractText: "The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business
    Innovation Research Phase II project is to offer a low-cost novel filter to purify
    water with higher effectiveness and superior performance than currently available
    technologies such as carbon filters. The global water scarcity, including some
    parts of the US such as the southwest, has led to a strong need for efficient
    technologies to purify wastewater for direct or indirect potable reuse. Recently,
    there has been growing concerns over emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated
    compounds (PFCs e.g. PFOA and PFOS) in surface and groundwater. These PFCs are
    being found at many groundwater sites and in drinking water wells affected by
    PFCs. Current technologies are not efficient for the removal of PFCs from water,
    and there is an immediate need for new cost-effective treatment technologies.
    To address this unfulfilled need, this project seeks to develop a low cost, reusable
    filter unit for water purification to remove emerging contaminants such as PFCs.
    The technology is expected to be used by entities conducting industrial wastewater
    and groundwater treatment, and wastewater utilities that have a focus on water
    reuse. \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a prototype
    water filter,  test and optimize it for the removal of emerging contaminants with
    a focus on PFCs. Specifically, the project will focus on: (1) optimization of
    the adsorbent performance and synthesis method; and scale-up of the synthesis
    method for bulk production of filter media; (2) optimization of the filter regeneration
    process; and (3) design, construct, and test a prototype unit of the technology;
    and determine the process cost. The work will confirm the effectiveness of the
    filter in removing the target contaminants as well as the effectiveness of the
    regeneration process to reuse the filter. The PFC contaminants will be first removed
    from the water and then destroyed. The overall performance of the technology will
    also be evaluated and compared with other available technologies to determine
    its cost-effectiveness."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve outcomes for cardiothoracic surgical patients while reducing healthcare costs by ensuring proper post-surgical drainage. In the United States, approximately 750,000 major cardiothoracic surgeries are performed each year. Each of these patients receives an average of two chest tubes to drain fluid and facilitate proper recovery, but approximately 36% of chest tubes become clogged. Patients with clogged chest tubes are more likely to experience post-surgical complications, which can result in life-threatening conditions and significantly increase the cost of care. To mitigate the risk of clogging, surgeons typically use large-bore chest tubes, which are more likely to be misplaced and to cause injury to surrounding organs. The novel device under development addresses these issues by preventing clog formation in small-bore chest tubes, thus maintaining proper fluid drainage. Anticipated impacts of the device include reduced time to ambulation and discharge, hospital readmissions, and nursing time. Commercially, the device addresses a $300 million initial market opportunity and has the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion per year from costs associated with preventable chest tube complications.

    The proposed project aims to develop a novel chest tube device to address the clinical need of maintaining proper fluid drainage after cardiothoracic surgery while enabling the use of small-bore chest tubes. Existing systems are prone to clogging, which can lead to life-threatening conditions, longer hospital stays, and increased costs. Building on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, the objective of this research is to continue development of the device and prepare for market entry; the research will be performed in three Aims. In the first Aim, critical aspects of usability and manufacturability will be addressed and incorporated into the final device design. In the second Aim, verification and validation activities will be performed to ensure the device meets all safety and functional requirements before clinical use. In the third Aim, the device?s supplemental ability to monitor lung healing status in patients undergoing thoracic surgery will be refined and tested on the benchtop and in an in vivo animal study.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in enabling more efficient Annual Wind Energy Production (AEP) while reducing the cost of energy (COE). This will make wind energy more attractive economically, improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and indirectly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A 2% AEP increase is generally considered attractive. Two turbines (5kW and 50kW) tested during Phase I have shown an increase in AEP between 2% to 8% while reducing the COE by 1% to 6%. About 150,000 turbines worldwide can be potentially be retrofitted with this technology.

    This project will address challenges related to aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbines and the cost of wind energy. It is based on a deeper understanding of wind turbine aerodynamics from a more 3-dimensional point of view; most wind turbine designs are based on 2- dimensional theories. The key technical challenge in bringing this technology to market is to demonstrate the increase in AEP of utility scale turbines retrofitted with our deflector technology in realistic field conditions while reducing the COE. This will be addressed by performing testing at a few customer wind farms and NREL testing centers. The R&D plan consists of designing, manufacturing, and installing deflectors on a few utility size turbines (30-100 meters diameter rotors). The tests will include power performance comparison between baseline and retrofitted turbines according to international standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of an informatics-based software platform that will help pharmaceutical companies create more new, effective, and safe drugs earlier in the R&D pipeline. This software platform will address a need for data integration and analysis tools to aid pharmaceutical researchers in 1) phenotypic screening, 2) toxicology analysis, and 3) drug repurposing. It will help these researchers quickly gather and interpret complex molecular and phenotypic data, making the drug discovery process more efficient and creating value for pharmaceutical companies. The economic impact of reducing the preclinical drug discovery process by just two weeks is estimated to be a $252 million cost savings for the industry. By using data more effectively earlier in the R&D process, this software platform also promises to enhance the quality of drugs that enter clinical trials. Thus, it provides an opportunity to reduce overall R&D spending and increase the number of drugs that enter the market - resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build an informatics-based software platform that solves cross-domain data integration, analysis, and user application challenges in order to effectively use data to draw insights earlier in the R&D process and compress the development pipeline for new or repurposed drugs. Using highly scalable semantic graph technologies, a flexible three-layer architecture is being developed that includes the 1) Biomedical Data Layer, 2) Computational Layer, and 3) Application Layer. This architecture allows the system be fully scalable and extensible to other datasets and biomedical applications. The system will be beta-tested by pharmaceutical researchers and evaluated though the creation of scientifically relevant use-cases. This development will result in a commercial software system that makes important biomedical data and insights available to all researchers within a pharmaceutical organization by addressing high need data integration, analysis, and application challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that is not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process user data.  For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity yet lower cost, lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise level reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions. The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include machine learning for video analytics, genome sequencing and enabling Fog Storage and Fog Computing, among others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project explores the Big Data paradigm shift where processing capability is pushed as close to the data as possible. The In-Situ processing technology pushes this concept to the absolute limit, by putting the computational capability directly into the storage itself and eliminating the need to move data to main memory before processing. The technology innovation begins with a solid foundation of an enterprise SSD tailored for the needs of modern Data Centers. Key technology that will be added to support these capabilities include hardware-assisted quality of service control, low-cost 3D-TLC and QLC NAND Flash enablement through the use of advanced ECC, and a proprietary elastic Flash Translation Layer to support extremely large capacity drives. The final element added to this foundation will be the ability to perform computation directly on the data with the addition of specialized In-Situ processing aided by hardware accelerators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from it having far-reaching societal, commercial, and technological impact. (1) Initial research by the Principal Investigator on analyzing the energy drain of AngryBirds has demonstrated the severe energy inefficiency of popular mobile apps in today's app market. The importance of this work is heightened by smartphones being an important enabler of Internet access for disadvantaged people in both developed and developing countries, and hence being an important tool in overcoming the "digital divide". (2) Commercially, the project will foster a paradigm shift in the mobile app industry ($101B industry in 2020) from the current feature-centric to energy-aware app design. Such a paradigm shift will have a significant, long lasting impact on the app industry. Energy-efficient apps lead to longer battery life, which in turn leads to longer user engagement time, which ultimately translates into millions of dollars of increased mobile revenue as all major businesses are shifting towards mobile. Hence this SBIR project will lead to a marketable product. (3) Technically, the proposed work will extend the performance profiling technology that is foundational to the software industry into the energy dimension, which is critical to the mobile software industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the industry's first app energy management (AEM) solution to help app developers reduce app battery drain, and extend the battery life of billions of smartphones. The research objectives are (1) to develop advanced energy debugging techniques that can automatically identify energy drain opportunities from legitimate energy hotspots; and (2) to develop an SDK-based app energy monitoring system for monitoring app energy drain when running on consumer phones in the open market. These objectives pose significant technical challenges. While similar challenges on performance metrics (such as running time) have been well studied for traditional software, in particular in high-performance computing, in this project the company is expanding them to the energy dimension for the mobile app industry, which has not been attempted before. The company will develop novel machine-learning based solutions to learn, classify, and auto-detect energy optimization opportunities. As a result it expects to develop the first set of solutions to these fundamental challenges in optimizing the energy drain of millions of mobile apps in the app market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the proposed runtime verification technology will lead to a more robust definition of and architecture for ensuring safety in automobiles, medical devices, and aerospace and defense systems.  Through this, these forms of safety-critical infrastructure will be more resilient to attack and catastrophic failure resulting from both critical system failures and malicious attacks.  As a result, the technology will help to address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that inevitably occur as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of safety-critical embedded systems safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize a first-of-its-kind complete solution for runtime verification and software analysis specifically tailored for embedded systems.  From automobiles that connect to each other and drive autonomously, to control systems that run ever increasing networks that power our utilities, cities, and many other aspects of our daily lives, it is clear that embedded systems are here to stay in the most safety critical domains.  A growing problem in embedded systems is how to ensure they behave correctly; a good case study for this is automobiles, in which several high profile hacks and recalls have called into question the security and integrity of vehicles.  The proposed solution will fill this market niche with a suite of related analysis tools/modules, built on a common novel and formally rigorous runtime verification technology infrastructure, each module implementing unique instrumentation and analysis functionality.  These tools/modules together provide what is needed to develop safe embedded systems.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at improving healthcare patient outcomes,
    potentially saving lives, and decreasing healthcare costs. The Drug Quality and
    Security Act of 2013 set stricter manufacturing standards on sterile injectable
    compounded medications that have closed many third party suppliers, thus creating
    shortages and higher prices.  In response, the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists
    expects 40% of the US market, 2000 hospitals, by 2018 to receive insourced compounds.
    \ Hospitals that insource hope to decrease their costs and improve patient safety
    with higher quality product.  Today, insourcing hospitals often have multiple
    information systems and use paper records cobbling together how a compound is
    made and to whom it has been administered.  When an ingredient recall occurs,
    hospitals spend hundreds of man-hours identifying the problem source and affected
    patients. To prevent further patient risks speed is demanded. This SBIR Phase
    I project will provide hospitals the capability of an end-to-end quality management
    that will track every production process step and tracing medications to patients.
    \ Hospitals will be able to prevent patients from receiving recalled medications
    and identify quality production compromises thus improving patient outcomes and
    potentially saving lives.  \n\n\nThe proposed project is a novel medication barcoded
    label encryption technology compatible with existing hospital scanners to provide
    track and trace capabilities of intravenous medication compounds.   Key objectives
    include both patient specific and anticipatory workflows with labels, a Passive
    Auditing management system for compounding quality control, and an innovation
    to improve operating room environment medication barcode scanning compliance.
    \ Today, healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with
    minimal embedded medication data across disparate systems.  Medication labels
    could be the link across these systems for ingredient traceability.  However,
    existing solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates.
    \ The project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded
    label connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually
    to the patient.  Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental
    conditions, and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication
    labels and stored in the patient?s electronic record.  When an ingredient is recalled
    or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted
    data from the EHR and will be connected to production data. Success of this project
    will be label readability by existing hospital scanners and retrieval of the serialized
    data from the EHR"

    proposed system will enhance the ability of the 1.3 million people currently living
    in the United States with a lower limb amputation to walk in unconstrained environments.
    \ The proposed Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System (QPAS) addresses the RH6:
    Human Assistive Technologies area.  QPAS will be lightweight, have a long battery
    life, and optimize the passive dynamics of amputee gait in unconstrained environments
    by using battery energy to tune its physical system properties, ankle equilibrium
    angle and torsional stiffness.  The device provides a unique set of features that
    do not currently exist in the market, strengthening its value proposition.  The
    amputee population is growing; 2,000 new lower limb amputation are performed each
    week.  Therefore, QPAS will have strong market potential and the significant societal
    impact of improving health by supporting a more active lifestyle for lower limb
    amputees.  This will also lead to more community and family involvement.  Additionally,
    because of the many possibilities to control QPAS, gait researchers will be able
    to study amputee compensation preferences.  A better understanding of the kinematic
    and kinetic preferences could lead to improvements in the design of purely passive
    ankle prostheses.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2
    project addresses the needs of lower limb amputees. Lower limb amputees suffer
    from reduced self-selected walking speed, increased metabolic cost, increased
    reaction loads on the sound limb, poor gait symmetry, and reduced stability with
    increased risk of falling.  Passive prosthetic feet are only tuned for level ground
    walking at one speed.  QPAS will utilize a patented compliant actuator to achieve
    a unique set of features: passive energy storage with an articulating ankle joint,
    adaptable ankle angle for slope gait, low electrical energy usage, a large range
    of ankle motion, adaptable stiffness to optimize variable cadence level ground
    and slope gait, and controlled energy delivery to ensure energy builds naturally
    and smoothly.  In this phase 2 SBIR, an intuitive and autonomous controller will
    be built for the QPAS and human subject evaluations will assist in refining the
    device towards commercialization. QPAS will become a successful product by focusing
    on improved amputee gait performance in unconstrained environments, and being
    simple to fit and adjust, reliable and affordable."

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop an easy to use real-time formative assessment tool for educators that will be uniquely aligned to each student and deployed via a virtual reality learning game that uses venomous marine snails as a conduit for exploring scientific issues in nature. The USA is currently ranked 52nd in the world in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies indicate it is not what is taught, but how it is taught that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. As a result, this project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project is a proprietary multi-tiered formative assessment tool that can measure real time student learning of novel STEM content obtained through a virtual reality learning game experience. This project will enable teachers to nimbly tailor future instruction with individualized student learning goals.  Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific learning and measurable engagement in educational games for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF?s mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists.

    The proprietary technology developed in this SBIR Phase II will be a first-of-its-kind assessment dashboard that will link virtual reality and web-based learning environments with formative assessment to fuel instruction and deepen learning. This project will build proprietary assessment tools into online and virtual reality games which continuously engage users in the process of scientific inquiry and discovery using novel formative assessments customized to each player. The proprietary assessment dashboard allows teachers and players to measure their progress in real-time and identify opportunities to enhance their STEM learning. Using Unity as the platform, player actions and decisions will be met with tailored formative assessments and ongoing feedback throughout game play. This feedback helps teachers delineate where their students are along their learning progressions and fuels further instruction. The novel approach of this assessment dashboard transforms qualitative and quantitative learning and has the potential to significantly enhance student engagement and commitment to scientific inquiry to support emerging science changemakers. The research objective of the player/teacher dashboard is to align feedback on student learning during game play with dynamic quantitative and qualitative formative assessment that create a seamless demonstration of knowledge acquisition while providing teachers with multiple opportunities to engage learners in deeper and more meaningful levels of inquiry before, during, and after gameplay. The products generated from this project are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program to ensure the content is of the highest caliber and distribution is to a large global customer base. The anticipated results from exposing teachers and students to this project will be increased competencies in STEM, which will transform players into lifelong learners and enhance engagement in STEM fields and careers.

    support the technological refinement and concomitant commercialization of the
    first accurate and portable instrument that can perform in the field nondestructive
    test for hardness, strength and ductility of existing infrastructure. The material
    properties measured include yield strength, work hardening exponent and ultimate
    tensile strength of metals, specifically steel. The on-shore oil and gas pipeline
    transmission industry has pressing needs for non-destructive tests because of
    the aging infrastructure, national need for energy, and recent explosions and
    leaks that have cost lives and billions in remediation. Although transmission
    pipelines have low failure rate per mile of assets, pipeline operators are asked
    to proactively enhance pipeline integrity where they do not have all the necessary
    strength data.  Therefore, there is an immediate need to verify strength during
    the 80,000 excavations done each year so that the life of these costly assets
    can be extended by identifying and remediating the few sections that are vulnerable
    within the extended network of 300,000 miles of pipelines. Pipe cut-outs and hydrostatic
    pressure tests are alternatives to nondestructive testing, but both damage the
    asset and require expensive and complex service interruption. \n\nThe overall
    technical objective of the Phase II work is to perform the necessary research
    and development to enable the development of engineering specifications, system
    integration, and validation of the instrument to successfully perform valuable
    nondestructive testing to provide precise and accurate material property data.
    The research and development program includes three milestones, each enabling
    the implementation of the research into design and manufacturing of beta test
    units.  Milestone 1 is to enable full instrument functionality under adverse field
    environments such as vibration, moisture, and extreme temperatures. Milestone
    2 is to perform the necessary work for designing ruggedized field units. Completion
    of this milestone will enhance the capability for initial field testing services.
    \ Milestone 3 is to develop the knowledge to fully and reliably integrate the
    system, validate the sub-systems, and package it for manufacturing. The overall
    goal is to enable the company to have the necessary knowledge and experience to
    enter the instrument market with a leasing program for use in pipeline inspections."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new alloys whose thermal expansion properties can be tailored for laser applications. The tailored thermal expansion alloys will prevent shifts in laser output frequencies, i.e. laser color, by preventing the natural temperature-induced thermal expansion and contraction that occurs in laser housings. This temperature stability is extremely important for fiber-optic systems that are the backbone of the telecommunications industry. According to Strategies Unlimited, the telecommunications laser market was $3.515 billion in 2014, and it is expected to increase with the increasing number of mobile devices and growing demand for high-speed internet. While oil and gas telecommunications systems were identified as the beachhead market, the alloys developed through this project will also have potential to add value to the wider telecommunications market and a number of other industrial and electronics applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a new method to exhibit unprecedented control over thermal expansion properties in metal alloys. The discovery that mechanical deformation tailors or "programs" the thermal expansion of a bulk metal to match that of other common materials (metals, polymers, and ceramics) will change the way scientists and engineers design for thermal compensation. These alloys can also be tailored not to expand or contract with temperature changes and even be made to shrink when heated. This wide range of tailored alloy responses is achieved without chemical changes or composite fabrication methods upon which competing technologies rely. This Phase II project will reduce the risks associated with implementing the tailored thermal expansion alloy technology in laser applications by developing high thermal conductivity alloys and testing prototypes. Alloys will be purchased, engineered to have a desired coefficient of thermal expansion, and tested for laser performance. The expected outcome of this work is the realization of tailored thermal expansion alloys in laser prototypes.

    3-4-tip devices for probing integrated circuits.  These will be offered in a variety
    of sizes and geometries, currently from hundreds of nm to 65 nm, and extending
    below 10 nanometers within a year.  In Phase II, probe functionality will be enhanced

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate the use of a new carbon-based water treatment process to condition and soften hard water sources. Specifically, this treatment process uses functionalized porous carbon sheets and small applied electrical voltages (<1.2 V) to target (adsorb and desorb) salt molecules from hard water streams. In addition, this process is reversible, resulting in a carbon-based filter that can soften water streams without significant maintenance or upkeep and providing a water softening solution that does not add to the "throw-away" culture that is common to many water treatment devices. Importantly, no salt or chemical additives are needed for this softening technique, further limiting its environmental impact in comparison to conventional salt-based softeners, and the energy required for this separation may best the most efficient techniques in use today.

    The proposed process is called inverted capacitive deionization (i-CDI). In i-CDI, salt molecules are naturally attracted to the carbon electrode surfaces due to the creation of electrodes possessing significant surface charge in aqueous environments. Electrodes are then regenerated using a small voltage, matched to the surface chemistry of the functionalized carbon electrodes, and salt is concentrated into a discharge stream. Through this Phase II project, the i-CDI process will be demonstrated for water softening applications in both food & beverage and industrial environments. Currently, water softening in these industries is carried out through chemical treatments, ion exchange, or selective membranes. In this project, surface charged carbon electrodes will be used in "flow-through" cell modules to demonstrate preferential removal of calcium, magnesium, carbonate, and other hardness-causing ions to soften multiple hard water sources. Comparisons will be drawn between this new i-CDI technology and incumbent water treatment techniques to outline benefits towards equipment downtime, energy costs, and effectiveness of the separation. Liquid sampling and lifetime studies will be conducted to further prove the benefits of this membrane-free, salt-free system.

    Research Phase II project provides a technology platform to convert non-food biomass,
    such as wood and corn stalks, into biofuels, chemicals, and bioproducts. Biomass
    utilization is a solution to increase global sustainability and decrease petroleum-based
    greenhouse gas emissions. This project will use wood biomass to simultaneously
    co-produce three high-end products, dissolving pulp, furfural, and technical lignin,
    of which the dissolving pulp and furfural are the focus of this project. Current
    methods of producing these products only use one of the three primary biomass
    components. By co-producing two products, revenues increase and unit production
    costs decrease as production costs are spread over a larger product volume. The
    use of this solvent obtained from the biomass is a unique approach in the biomass
    conversion industry and offers an alternative to conventional enzyme or microbial
    processing. Benefits include restoring furfural production in the United States,
    decreasing dissolving pulp production costs, and increasing the commercial value
    of renewable biomass that currently has low or no value. This sustainable and
    environmentally friendly technology will increase global sustainability and revitalize
    rural economies by stimulating investment and creating jobs. \n\nThe objectives
    of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate and advance to pilot scale
    our technology to simultaneously co-produce dissolving pulp and furfural from
    biomass using gamma valerolactone (GVL) as solvent. While other technologies focus
    on the production of a single product from biomass, GVL?' ability to fractionate
    lignocellulosic biomass into its three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose,
    and lignin) at high concentration and purity, produce significant cost and technical
    advantages. GVL fractionation produces solid cellulose at high yield (>90%) and
    purity (>90%), without the need for pre-treatment or further chemical refining.
    This cellulose can be converted into dissolving pulp for high-end applications
    such as textiles (rayon), cellophane, or microcrystalline cellulose. The hemicellulose
    fraction does not need to be separated from the GVL and is readily converted into
    furfural within GVL at high yields (>75%) and high concentrations, minimizing
    separation costs. Preliminary mass and energy balances and techno-economic modeling
    based on lab data predict attractive financial returns. Tasks will focus on biomass
    fractionation to produce dissolving pulp, furfural purification, and GVL recovery
    at bench-scale. This experimental work will inform the engineering development
    for an integrated, continuous process, pilot demonstration unit."

    improve and expand the technology of recyclable thermosets by creating a new class
    of higher temperature performance, multivalent polyamines that retain a cleavable
    bond. If successful, this effort will lead to a new class of high-performance
    composite resins which can be recycled. Increased emphasis on energy efficiency
    is driving the adoption of lightweight, thermoset composites in the transportation
    sector. But the intractability of traditional thermosets limits the value and
    therefore adoption of recycled composites. Industry composites recycling experts
    estimate the overall scrap cost for the composites industry is between $500 and
    $750 million a year. Post-manufacturing scrap can account for up to 50 percent
    of the input materials. Carbon fiber composites for automotive applications represent
    an emerging and high-growth potential area for epoxy thermosets. A small volume,
    composite car line represents roughly 400 metric tons of polyamine curing agent.
    In the Phase II effort, novel, recyclable polyamine structures will be designed
    and synthesized, and further formulated with various epoxy resins to meet the
    glass transition temperature (Tg) requirements for transportation composites manufacturing.
    Doing so will help composite manufacturers lower costs and meet regulatory compliance
    for recyclability and manufacturing waste disposal. \n\nThe intellectual merit
    of this project will be an expanded knowledge base and chemistry platform for
    synthesizing and formulating recyclable thermoset resins. Multivalent amines,
    by nature, provide higher structural rigidity of a matrix. Multivalency, by nature,
    translates to an overall higher cross-link density of a thermoset epoxy material.
    For example, composites of higher glass transition temperature, and faster cure
    speed can be achieved. New multivalent structures will complement the initial
    generation of recyclable aliphatic diamines, and enable applications previously
    unattainable by recyclable aliphatic structures alone, such as transportation
    composites. Pre-screened target cyclic scaffolds have been identified and targeted
    for synthesis. Successfully synthesized molecules will be further screened for
    physical properties and recyclability. Candidate molecules will then be formulated
    into full resin systems and optimized for a high-pressure resin transfer molding
    (HP-RTM) process, to meet the processing and cost needs of automotive manufacturers.
    Partners in the automotive industries will aid in testing and evaluating the performance
    of the formulated material. By creating new recyclable molecules that \"mimic\"
    other major industrial classes beyond aliphatic amines, the addressable market
    for these materials will be expanded and the adoption of recyclable thermoset
    composites will be accelerated."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide a usable stranded and associated gas collection capacity for oil & gas exploration companies. During drilling operations, valuable gas is lost through intentional venting and flaring, causing losses in natural gas delivered to the power plant or city gate. With the sector's expansion into more remote low-volume sites, these losses are increasing dramatically. Through this project's proposed novel Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based storage technology, this project seeks to deliver a re-usable and transport ready intermodal container, to store gas at low pressure, eliminating the need to use expensive gas capture, purification and multi-stage compression systems. An economically feasible unprocessed natural gas storage technology would provide a useful tool for the domestic oil & gas industry in capturing what would be flared or vented and delivering it to the American economy. Taking the proposed novel MOF technology to the bench and pilot scale will show the feasibility of a flexible, transportable, low-cost infrastructure to abate flaring and venting. Successful developments in this project will help develop the knowledge for scale-up to large-scale vehicular tanks to allow for commercial implementation.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are the development of stable and low-cost Metal-Organic framework (MOF) based storage technologies for the collection of usable stranded associated gas during drilling operations. In order to harness point source emissions, before being vented or flared, the project will develop a nano-engineered, MOF based sorbent for low-pressure capture and storage of unprocessed natural gas. The project will seek to develop a robust and scalable method to synthesize new MOFs containing other high-valence transition metal ions such as Al3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+. Furthermore, the project will screen a range of organic ligands for improving MOFs' surface property and storage capacity. Finally, by following alternative synthesis routes with low cost catalysts, the project will identify sorbent synthesis cost reduction strategies. The sorbent material will be tested with simulated vent/flare-gas compositions in a cyclic pressure range and the sorbent stability will be verified by an assortment of X-ray, spectroscopy, and microscopy methods. Following sorbent development, an ANG tank will be built and flare gas slipstream testing will be conducted in shale gas sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to transform commercial construction through the democratization of scanning and automation of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Constant design and change management is a unique challenge that is costing the US construction industry billions of dollars annually. In order to prevent such a huge economic loss, this industry is in the path for a digital revolution. BIM is known as the first truly global digital technology that could revolutionize the construction industry. However, BIM usage is currently limited because it is only viable for large-scale projects. The primary reason is that the process is too laborious and expensive. The proposed technology will completely eliminate these barriers. Its ease-of-use, ubiquity of the capturing device, and automated object detection democratizes as-built BIM modeling. Enormous value could be generated due to streamlining and data management capabilities that are offered by the technology in the form of accelerated project schedules, reduced numbers of requests for information and change orders, and timely identified design clashes. This will pave the way to increase the competitiveness of the US construction industry, by enabling new products and services that support automatic BIM modeling.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the technical and commercial feasibility of an automatic and inexpensive solution for the Scan-to-BIM problem in the construction industry. Scan-to-BIM refers to 3D scanning of a physical structure and converting the captured raw spatial data into an object-oriented, semantically-rich model. Although there are a few technologies that aim to facilitate this process, the 3D modeling component remains primarily a manual and time-consuming task. When using the proposed technology, a non-technical worker videotapes the target structure. The video is automatically sent to a server for processing. A unique videogrammetric 3D reconstruction engine reconstructs the 3D geometry of the structure in the form of a 3D point cloud. It then extracts object hypotheses from key video frames and spatial data in the form of observations. Afterwards, it optimizes a novel coherent joint probability distribution function and infers a 3D layout. The outcome is an object-oriented 3D representation of the structure with embedded geometrical attributes and property sets. The main novelty of this technology lies in a hybrid approach that combines low-level segmentation with high-level space modeling. This advances the state-of-the-art in robust intelligence, particularly the interpretation of complex, unstructured data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to promote and improve the use of high quality video in products that the general public works with every day.  From high resolution auto dashboard cameras, to low latency video streams from flying drones, to wireless laptop docking stations, to higher quality coverage of news and sporting events, to better and faster delivery of video over the Internet, every application requires the high quality, low latency, flexible, power efficient video encoders that will be developed in this project.  The uses of video are increasing every day.  Video instruction manuals are replacing printed instruction manuals.  Video is replacing still images in on-line advertising, social media and billboards.  It is predicted that over 90% of all Internet traffic will be video data in the next few years.  Enabling all these applications requires the latest technology in video compression such as the techniques developed in this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project tackles the problem of creating a real time video encoder, using the latest H.265 compression technology, running in hardware on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).  An FPGA is a type of chip on which the logic is configurable - it can be programmed to implement any function.  It represents a mid-point between a dedicated integrated circuit, which is very expensive to develop, and can never be changed or enhanced once it is fabricated, and a pure software solution which is very flexible but requires bulky and power hungry equipment (i.e. computers) as an underlying platform.  The research conducted under this grant will devise, test, and implement algorithms that are amenable to realization on an FPGA, that operate in real time, and that yield a high quality result in terms of the visual quality of the compressed video with respect to the number of bits used.  The goal, at the conclusion of this research, is the demonstration of a functional HEVC/H.265 encoder running on an FPGA which has cost, flexibility, power and performance advantages over other encoders.

    affect between 30-50 million people worldwide, and lead to a loss of independence
    for the individual, as well as an increased burden on their caregivers. While
    improved quality of life is the most vital outcome of this technology, reduction

    doctors will also be of benefit to the broad healthcare field.  The work outlined
    in this SBIR proposal also has the potential to significantly impact our understanding
    of retinal degenerative diseases, which will help in developing better and more
    effective treatments for a number of ophthalmic indications. The subretinal implant
    under development provides the framework for the next generation of high-resolution

    and will help these patients regain independence and thus improve their quality
    of life. \n\nThe proposed project will expand on the data collected from the in
    vivo surgical development and ex vivo efficacy studies supported by our Phase
    I/IB awards.  First, a 40-animal rat study will be undertaken to further investigate
    the biocompatibility of the retinal implant.  Second, previously developed surgical
    procedures will be refined in pigs to ensure reproducible and safe subretinal

    retinal implant using retinal pigment epithelial cells.   Additionally, medical
    device sealants will be investigated in this in vitro study, and the functional
    integrity of the implant will be measured using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy
    and an ion-sensitive detector, which is being developed specifically for this
    application.  Lastly, this ion-sensitive detector will provide an opportunity
    to further measure the spatial sensitivity of the retinal implant with high resolution.
    \ These in vivo and in vitro studies are vital for the continued evaluation of

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address one of the primary barriers to the emergence of flexible electronics -the inability to assembly and interconnect thinned integrated circuits (ICs) onto flexible substrates in a reliable, cost-effective, high volume manner. Flexible electronics has been the subject of many industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports. All describe a new age of ubiquitous electronics with devices embedded in the structures and items around us.  Flexible electronic devices, unlike today's devices that are rigid and boxy, can conform to natural, curved shapes that exist in the real world. However, flexible electronics have yet to have their predicted economic and social impact. A major reason is because the electronics industry has not yet found a reliable, low-cost method for assembling thin, flexible ICs onto flexible circuit boards. Today's 'pick-and-place' assembly technology cannot handle ICs thin enough to be flexible. Until a new method is developed and adopted, the potential of flexible electronics will likely not be realized.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the integrated circuit (IC) aspects of a flexible hybrid electronics technology to a level at which these devices can be produced reliably and in volumes in a production-relevant environment. While most of the components of flexible hybrid electronics technology relating to printed electronics methods have been adequately researched and developed, little has been done on the integration of solid-state semiconductor devices onto highly flexible, organic substrates. Partial results have been reported in the literature, however, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive, wafer-to-end product approach suitable for commercial applications. This project will address this gap by focusing on all the steps for IC integration, including the preparation for assembly of ultra-thin, flexible semiconductor dies, their attachment onto a flexible circuit board using laser-enabled assembly technology, and their reliable electrical interconnection. The anticipated end results will be a complete flexible hybrid electronics integration technology developed to a level of pilot production readiness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an online, fully automated platform for designing high-affinity antibodies for use as potential drug candidates. The success of antibody-based drugs has generated interest in faster and more efficient methods to discover and optimize antibodies. The goal of this project will be to develop and implement a computational method for producing protein sequences of humanized antibodies. This will be achieved by providing software that allows scientists to move some of their initial experiments into the cloud, and achieve results much more quickly by using computational methods saving time and cost for new drug development. In addition, it is anticipated that this will improve the features of antibody-based drug candidates, enhance the success rate of clinical studies, and accelerate the commercialization of new drugs.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and implement computational tools for designing antibodies that are more effective, have fewer side effects, and have fewer problems in manufacturing. Current computational design methods rely almost entirely on the expertise of scientists iterating between experimental and bioinformatics approaches. An automated, systematic approach will help researchers design better antibodies with desired features in a shorter amount of time. The final platform will allow researchers to incorporate experimental and structural information to develop better drugs by determining which experiments will be necessary, assessing the viability of a potential candidate, and identifying structural features responsible for the molecule?s stability, immune response, and binding properties. The typical antibody design process takes many months and tens of thousands of dollars. With the aid of a computational process, this time can be cut back to the click of a button.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of genetically engineered tobacco plants that produce antibodies for the treatment of individuals infected with the Ebola virus. In the recent Ebola outbreak, a new antibody-based drug was shown to be effective in treating infected patients that was based on a transient tobacco-produced Ebola antibody cocktail called ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc, San Diego, CA). Unfortunately, Mapp Biopharmaceutical's supply of antibody was quickly depleted, as the manufacturing method was not able to keep up with demand. The technological innovation in this proposal is the targeted production of antibodies within the gland cells of the tobacco leaf surface structures called glandular secreting trichomes. The research objectives will be to demonstrate the secretion of antibodies to the Ebola virus from tobacco trichome glands. The goal is to generate a line of N. tabacum plants that is optimized for antibody production in plant trichomes to provide a biomanufacturing platform for the large-scale production of antibodies that may be used in the treatment of Ebola infection, and in the future, other diseases.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use a recently developed plant-based biomanufacturing system to scale-up the production of antibodies to the Ebola virus for use as a therapeutic treatment. Mapp Biopharmaceutical has produced a drug based on antibodies to the Ebola virus produced in a tobacco plant transient gene expression system.  Using this system, they have identified a glycosylated antibody variant (glycoform) with enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Using glycosyl-transferase knockout lines of N. benthiamiana and transient expression strategies, the company utilizes plants to produce glycosylated antibodies that produce optimal recruitment of natural immune effector cells (Olinger et al., 2012). Other expression hosts (Chinese hamster ovary cells, yeast) yield product with reduced potency, and are not suitable alternatives. To recover active antibody with their current plant expression technology, Mapp Biopharmaceutical must destructively harvest plants, and isolate antibody from plant tissue homogenates. Unfortunately, this method has not been able to produce enough antibodies to satisfy the demand.  The proposed method will allow for the production of antibodies in tobacco plants in large scale.  In addition, the proposed system will use antibody harvesting strategies that do not require destructive homogenization as the antibodies will be secreted onto the surface of the leaf, and recovered by washing. The goals of this project are to increase the functionality of plant-produced antibodies, scale-up production, and reduce the costs of production further through system optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will enable a group of customers we call Risk Pricers (specifically, property and casualty insurance underwriters and mortgage bankers in financial firms) to profit from tailoring pricing on their products. They can do this by rapidly predicting financial losses for buildings having specific configurations, using the software developed in this proposal. These customers can then tailor pricing of earthquake insurance and mortgage terms based on refined analyses that we facilitate. Besides offering a clear financial benefit to Risk Pricers, this new analysis approach will also fundamentally change market forces and incentives around building safety. If a building's owner is incentivized to improve its earthquake performance (via lower insurance and mortgage costs), then high-performance buildings become more appealing and this will encourage design of better buildings. As the company's software makes more explicit the links between building properties and financial costs, society will benefit from more efficient resource allocation, ultimately leading to increased societal resilience.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop algorithms and software tools that provide financial guidance to customers interested in repair costs and closures of buildings due to earthquakes.  To complete the development of its tool, the company will focus on calibrating statistical models to predict displacements and accelerations in a wide range of building types, when they are subjected to earthquake shaking. The company's method for rapid estimation of structural responses utilizes principles of engineering mechanics, but applied in a domain where academic research does not focus (i.e., estimating response of a structure whose properties are not fully known to the analyst). The key identified need is to calibrate a statistical predictive model for the response of a structure that is effective over all popular construction types of interest to customers in the insurance and mortgage banking markets (i.e., light frame wood, steel, concrete, concrete tilt-up). The company will also develop loss metric and calculation outputs that incorporate insurance contract conditions such as deductibles and limits, in order to link the calculations to customers' workflows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project in the long term has two main components.  First, the development has potential to reduce the country's overall energy consumption by funding the development of low cost air quality sensors for energy efficient buildings.  And second, the project will enhance the safety of our natural gas infrastructure with a low cost, low power methane (natural gas) sensor technology.    This work will develop a methane (natural gas) sensor prototype with 10x lower cost, size and power consumption than current solutions.  The proposed methane sensor will meet several currently unmet needs.  These include enhanced public safety by enabling methane leak detection for natural gas distribution systems, and protecting first responders by enabling more and better methane detection in hazardous environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the world's most porous materials, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a sensing material.  MOFs have been an active topic in material science research for over a decade, but they have yet to find a commercial application.  This project promises to be the first commercialization of this exciting new class of materials.  Nearly 40,000 different MOF structures have been identified to date.  The crux of this work is to use a combination of computer models and laboratory experimentation to optimize a MOF structure that selectively and rapidly absorbs methane gas.  The end goal of this project is to develop a commercial prototype methane sensor 'on a chip' that consists of a solid state mass transducer with the MOF coating that has been tuned for sensing methane.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be high performance error correction for flash memory. Error correction plays a critical row in making digital devices reliable. Shrinking semiconductor geometries results in more errors. This has created a special problem for flash memory where the need for more rigorous error correction is approaching a practical limit with the widely used Bose Chaudhuri Hocquengham error correction. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) is a recognized solution that  can approach the theoretical limits of what is possible. This LDPC based technology can improve lifetime of flash by without the added cost of the existing BCH solution. This technology helps Flash Memory enterprises to use higher density flash to improve storage capacity and cut the storage product costs. Without the superior performance, small size and low power consumption of the LDPC technology, the migration to low cost high capacity flash memories will be seriously slowed. In the absence of a comparable alternative approach, there will be serious limitations on the performance of a vast array of products that depend on highly reliable and economical flash storage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a variety of  techniques to minimize the area and power requirements and enhance the performance of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error correction codes for flash memory. Many of these techniques are applicable to a wide range of error correction applications in digital communication and storage from WiFi to hard disk drives. The need for better error correction is crucial for flash memory but there is a widening demand for improved error correction. For example larger memories require better error correction to insure the system failure rate is low. In the next two years the company expects to develop a Verilog version of the LDPC decoder that is easily integrated with a flash controller. The project will work with potential customers/partners to ensure the code works with controllers. In the long run these techniques can be adapted to a wide range of applications as the need for more reliable data continues to rapidly expand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can be found across the semiconductor industry with its initial market in wireless communications.  Due to the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), applications include low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, and RF power amplifiers (PAs). Looking forward, carbon nanotube transistors (CFETs) can reshape analog radio frequency electronics, enabling the higher data rates and improved capacity demanded by next generation wireless systems due to their intrinsic linearity and associated low out of band interference . CFETs are highly efficient, dissipating less unwanted power than current state of the art technologies while handling high power levels. This translates into more battery life for mobile devices with lower cooling costs. With more linear RF transistors, many billions of dollars of spending on additional base stations, larger batteries, and radio spectrum can be avoided, at great savings to consumers and industry. More speculatively, the creation of reliable grwoth techniques for CFETs and associated manufacturing processes may offer an excellent sensor platform or better ways to form on chip interconnects. The key problems being investigating of in situ growth of high performance nanotubes are applicable to the fabrication of CNT based devices for many electronic applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop electronic devices for radio frequency applications using carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  CNTs are a one dimensional material with diameters in the nanometer range. CNTs have unique and highly desirable properties ranging from superior mobility to current carrying capability to thermal stability.  Calculations show CNT amplifiers will be inherently linear with noise suppressed to the lowest possible quantum limit. These properties allow for electronic devices that will perform better than existing technologies, such as silicon and gallium arsenide.  Just as importantly, the cost for making these devices will be dramatically lower due to the relatively simple method for material synthesis and device fabrication. This work will enable wafer scale arrays of high density in-situ tubes to be grown on silicon enabling the development of carbon electronic components a manner comparable to silicon devices. This work will enable cost effective wafer scale growth of devices which exploit the groundbreaking linearity that CNTs can deliver.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer electronics market
    (mobile handsets, tablets, game consoles and wearables), wherein high performance, low power, small footprint
    multisensing (not limited to inertial sensing) platforms with timing devices, are all directly microfabricated on a common
    ASIC substrate. Sensor fusion can produce unprecedented user experiences by using data collected from all sensors and
    processed using machine learning algorithms. This can further boost the sensor and timing markets that are expected to
    exceed $6 billion dollars by 2017. Moreover, the emergent Internet of Things (IoTs) and wearable markets are expected to
    reach $20 billion dollars by 2025, which can induce a rapid growth of such intelligent sensor fusion market. This can have
    a tremendous societal impact as wearable devices and IoT systems, interfaced with mobile platforms, can be used to
    monitor people?s health, safety and energy consumption. Making these solutions affordable will make it amenable to low
    income households not only in the US but also around the world. It will also enable researchers to attain new frontiers of
    knowledge such as in digital sensory systems. The long-term goals are to provide such intelligent sensor fusion solutions.

    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to demonstrate wafer-scale microfabrication of
    Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
    substrates, by using electroplated copper (e-Cu) as a structural material. MEMS inertial sensors, such as gyroscopes and
    accelerometers, are pervasively used in consumer electronics and automotive industries. Current trends are, however,
    requiring higher device performance with smaller footprints, wherein multi-degree-of-freedom sensors are integrated on
    the same package, to enable new capabilities and user experiences. These requirements can be met by monolithically
    fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon as a structural material. Using e-
    Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the structural material, can enable easier routing to
    implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller dimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as
    no wafer bonding is required, smaller form factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing
    low noise and higher performance. Phase II tasks will be to wafer-scale fabricate an inertial measurement unit that is
    monolithically integrated with its ASIC with optimal performance parameters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of new tools to understand the dynamic behavior of cellular machinery that is disrupted in disease. Unraveling the dynamic aspects of cellular physiology that may be targeted therapeutically requires new technologies capable of profiling the response of entire signaling pathways to pharmacological intervention targeted at single pathway nodes. The availability of physiologically relevant live-cell models that are compatible with visualizing and quantifying the spatiotemporal regulation of disease-relevant signal transduction pathways and cellular machinery will be key to enabling this approach.  The ability to monitor multiple facets of key cancer signaling pathways in this way represents a valuable opportunity to identify potent and selective therapeutic inhibitors of "undruggable" targets, such as the Ras protein, which is a crucial driver of more than 30% of cancers. By enabling development of a robust and scalable high-throughput live-cell assay platform, this technology may reduce the time and cost to pinpoint the mechanism of action and off-target effects of pharmaceutical chemicals, thus delivering new capabilities to rapidly and cost-effectively identify safe and effective therapeutics.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a robust and flexible platform for rapid generation of precision-engineered, multicolor fluorescent cell lines and associated high-throughput microscopy-based assays. This platform contrasts with industry standard methods for developing such cell lines and assays, which are lengthy and inflexible.  The project comprises optimization and execution of four components:  1) Generation of a panel of cell lines compatible with rapid, reliable stable reporter integration; 2) Delivery of a library of approximately 25 multicolor reporters of the Ras/MAPK pathway; 3) Rapid generation and validation of a library of  approximately 100 validated stable reporter cell lines expressing all therapeutically relevant mutations and isoforms of the Ras/MAPK pathway;  and 4) 384-well plate assay development and screening of these Ras/MAPK reporter cells using tool compounds. The project aims to demonstrate the capability of the platform to rapidly pinpoint compound mechanism of action and potential off-target effects by monitoring multiple facets of previously inaccessible biology associated with a critical, high-value oncology target in live cells. The standardized platform established in the course of this project will allow rapid expansion to additional clinically relevant signaling pathways.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly reducing global carbon emissions using vacuum insulating glass. Vacuum glass is like a flat and transparent thermos bottle for windows. Vacuum glass has three times less heat loss than triple pane glass but costs no more to manufacture.  This disruptive value proposition will drive rapid market penetration, regardless of energy price, and without the need for government subsidy.  This project will produce vacuum insulating glass that will enable R-10 windows, consistent with the goals and schedule of the DOE Windows Roadmap.  Immediate benefits include improved occupant comfort and reduced heating bills without thermostat setback. Furthermore, vacuum windows will be condensation-free and fog-free forever. The potential impact is huge. Buildings represent 40% of total U.S. carbon emissions. Near-universal use could reduce total U.S. energy use by 3% (about 3 quadrillion BTU/year), while adding no cost to building infrastructure. Germany, Japan, Australia, China, and Russia have vacuum glass development programs; a successful development under this project will ensure that the U.S. stays at the scientific and technological forefront of this technology, and participates in a large and growing market.




    This project will develop the use of plasma degassing to achieve a vacuum life beyond 20 years, a condition for private investment. Without adequate degassing, moisture attached to internal surfaces is trapped at the time of seal-off. Trapped moisture molecules will later outgas, causing vacuum decay. Traditional high-temperature bakeout is too costly for affordable vacuum glass. Bakeout takes hours, but plasma degassing takes minutes. A German vacuum glass development effort tried plasma degassing under vacuum, which is inefficient. In contrast, this project will use atmospheric pressure plasma degassing, which is both faster and cheaper. Building on lessons learned during the Phase I project, a plasma treatment protocol will be developed to produce VIG panes as large as 25% of the average residential window size.  Working in parallel, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will work to optimize the insulating performance of the design to enable an R-10 window for the DOE Windows Roadmap. Thereafter, an integrated pilot line will be assembled, able to produce vacuum glass units suitable for meaningful retrofit projects. Finally, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will conduct accelerated life testing. Independent life data, combined with a successful operating pilot line, will help secure private investment for commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the potential to change the way gold mining is carried out by improving the process economics and reducing the environmental impact of mining operations. Current gold isolation methods involve the consumption of vast quantities of sodium cyanide, where cyanide is contained in large tailing dams, posing an environmental threat as exemplified by documented breaches. In the United States there are gold deposits which have not been exploited because of technology limitations and environmental concerns. The technology being developed in this project will improve the profitability of existing mines, as it can be employed with only minor changes in plant design. It will also  but will also lead to new jobs. Another opportunity is to extract gold from copper tailings dams. The proposed technology will potentially make cleanup of these sites profitable and can be applied worldwide. In the longer term, the process could be adopted in third world countries which still rely on mercury which pollutes, not only the environment, but also the food chain.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to (i) scale up the extraction of gold using both the heap and vat leach processes, (ii) optimize the crystallization of Au(III) in the presence of the natural product á-cyclodextrin, and (iii) isolate the gold. For heap leaching, it is proposed to operate at the 400-MT level, concentrate the gold salt and crystallize the gold-cyclodextrin complex. Scale-up will require designing the process to utilize existing equipment (built originally for the sodium cyanide process) and introducing new chemicals. For vat leaching, a small pilot system will be built to accept crushed ore as the feed, and the resulting gold-containing extract will be taken through the crystallization process. Optimization of the leaching agent, mass transfer, kinetics and materials consumption will be ongoing.  Regulatory approval for vat leaching, once secured, can be applied on-site globally to demonstrate the environmental and economic benefits of the process. This technology has the potential to significantly make existing and new mining operations more environmentally sustainable.

    proteins in algae using biomanufacturing. Some of the problems associated with
    having the animal livestock industry adapt a new product is demonstrating cost

    algae will be tested to determine their ability to assist animals in fighting
    off infections and also their ability to improve the animal's rate of weight gain.
    Finally, this project will strive to demonstrate that colostrum proteins produced
    in algae can give the same positive outcomes in animals when compared to animals
    given antibiotics. By accomplishing these goals, algae colostrum proteins can
    drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics and their negative side effects."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the ability of the haloacetic acids (HAAs) analyzer proposed here to change how superintendents of drinking water utilities go about understanding their drinking water treatment plants. The HAAs analyzer will allow superintendents to continuously map, monitor and then optimize their drinking water treatment practices using detailed and high quality measurements on the federally-regulated HAAs, which are carcinogens. Optimizing of the water treatment practices using the HAAs analyzer will reduce chemical usage (save money) while simultaneously providing the highest quality drinking water for their customers by minimizing HAAs. The commercial U.S. market for Drinking Water chemicals, contract operations, consulting/engineering, instrument and testing is $19.3 billion. The entire U.S. Water industry market is $86.4 billion. The major target of this proposal is the 28,643 traditional community water systems serving 90 % of the U.S. population. Some water systems struggled to meet Stage 1 Disinfection By-Product (DBP) regulations. Stage 2 of these regulations is stricter. The DBP regulations address long-term (decades' timescale) exposure to HAAs. Superintendents can use the proposed HAAs analyzer to understand hourly, short-term variations in their treatment plants to enhance long-term minimization of HAAs.



    This project will commercialize the first state-of-the-art instrument for fully automated, on-site process monitoring of the drinking water disinfection by-products known as haloacetic acids (HAAs). The HAAs analyzer proposed here has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of water treatment through reduction of treatment chemical usage at the water treatment plant while simultaneously improving and stabilizing water quality with respect to the carcinogenic and federally regulated HAAs. Currently, most drinking water treatment plants use contract laboratories to determine HAAs concentrations in the distribution system. This approaches can take 2 - 3 weeks to return the results at a significant expense for the equivalent hourly data provided by the proposed HAAs analyzer. The research objectives for this Phase II SBIR proposal are to develop components for the HAAs analyzer to enable long-term, maintenance free operation with minimal operator intervention. Simultaneously, costs will be reduced for both construction and operation of the HAAs analyzer to establish commercial feasibility. The anticipated results will be a HAAs analyzer that will provide water treatment personnel individual and Total HAAs concentrations once per hour, on-site and automatically.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be an improved cybersecurity posture among
    industries that rely on mission-critical computing systems that are difficult
    to patch and/or monitor. Many technical failures on these systems, including information
    breaches, equipment malfunctions, and malware infestations, stem from longstanding
    problems that go undetected.  This project develops nonintrusive measurement and
    analytics tools that give IT operators operational visibility into high-assurance
    assets, increasing confidence in their correct operation.  This project will reduce
    losses due to unscheduled maintenance across industries, improve the trustworthiness
    of embedded and semi-embedded systems such as software-based medical devices,
    and reduce the business risk of breaches and malware damage at organizations that
    rely on hard-to-manage devices. This project also advances the state of the art
    in detecting rogue software execution and other anomalies through nonintrusive
    side channels, such as observing power signals collected on a wall outlet. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to extend operational
    visibility of IT departments into mission-critical computing equipment using a
    novel combination of nonintrusive signal collection and machine learning. From
    infusion pumps to Internet routers to retail point-of-sale terminals, organizations
    rely on fixed-purpose computing systems. With this reliance comes three key risks.
    First, the effects of unscheduled interruptions to critical systems ripple outward
    to other business areas. Second, critical systems are often incompatible with
    constantly changing mainstream tools such as host-based antivirus and intrusion-detection
    systems. Third, critical systems often lag behind other systems patch levels because
    they are rarely taken out of service for patching. This project addresses these
    challenges by providing nonintrusive monitoring for critical systems in situ,
    reducing the risk of unscheduled downtime due to abnormal behavior. The company's
    monitoring hardware and software observe software execution from the vantage point
    of the power line, requiring no modifications to monitored systems and extending
    the ability of operators to understand what critical systems are doing."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the democratization of manufacturing through democratization of design and simulation technologies.  Geometric design systems and CAD tools are now widely available as standalone systems or cloud-based services, but simulation technologies remain inaccessible due to high cost, tedious data preparation, and demand of expertise in structural simulation. This project aims to make structural simulation widely available to both novice and expert users as a low cost fully automated service that requires no preprocessing or data conversion. The cloud-based simulation service is a disruptive technology that will make structural simulation widely available to communities of makers, as well as manufacturing enterprises, leading to dramatic improvements in performance, manufacturability, sustainability and cost savings. Wide adaption of simulation tools is also an important ingredient of STEM education and workforce development.


    This project will address the technical challenges identified in Phase I of the project, focusing on the goal of making cloud-based structural simulation service easily accessible and widely used. The key ingredients of the proposed approach are: (1) Development of novel user interaction modes and scenarios that enable rapid creation, composition, and editing of structural simulations by novice and expert users; (2) Guided interactive interpretation and exploration of simulation results aimed to not only to convey and explain simulation results, but also to engage the users into improving their designs by creating improved simulation scenarios. (3) Context-integrated simulations, where automated simulations are fully integrated with other services and delivered seamlessly within the context of common design or manufacturing applications, such as shape design, 3D printing, or manufacturability analysis.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a pulmonary function testing
    device for detection and diagnosis of pulmonary conditions. Today more than 650
    million globally, nearly 10% of the world's population, suffer from lung conditions
    like Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Currently, the most
    well-established method for lung function testing is spirometry, which requires
    the patient to conduct an unnatural breathing maneuver. In addition, spirometry
    cannot detect certain lung conditions. The proposed technology will be used without
    special breathing maneuver, and will be able to differentiate more lung conditions
    than spirometer. Since the proposed device can be used while the patient is breathing
    normally, it will also cater to currently under-served patient segments, e.g.
    young children and senior citizens, for detection and diagnosis of pulmonary conditions.
    By targeting a portable form-factor, the proposed technology will empower point-of-care
    pulmonary testing where it is currently infeasible.\n \nThe proposed project will
    develop the first handheld implementation of the well-studied principle of forced
    oscillation technique (FOT), where an acoustic pressure wave is sent via the mouth
    to a patient's lungs and reflections are used to measure lung function. Thus,
    no special breathing maneuver is required from the patient. Cognita Labs will
    adopt a modular approach for product design, and develop product-caliber advanced
    and integrated devices, that will include hardware, tablet app and EHR integration.
    The design will include all the innovations developed during Phase I to reduce
    the device size and cost while increasing its measurement accuracy. The proposed
    device will further develop and integrate a new ultra-sound based non-invasive
    sensor into the device to significantly reduce the cost of the consumable (disposable
    mouthpiece) and ultimately the cost of test. The team will also develop a new
    multi-resolution pre-screening test, with the objective to reduce bench time in
    outpatient clinics."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in advanced manufacturing. This project will develop a low cost, small-footprint high-resolution nanomanufacturing platform for building optical devices that are traditionally manufactured using cleanroom microlithography. Compared with modern cleanroom approaches that require significantly more complicated and expensive facilities, this platform holds strong promise to build visible-to-infrared wavelength optical components that are both smaller and lower cost, in order to serve the fiber-optic sensor, telecommunications, and lens markets. If this platform can deliver optics components that meet specifications, demand could reach 8-figures for a single customer, thus transforming optics manufacturing across the entire spectrum of markets that use photonics: biomedical, energy, military, and consumer. If it meets the needs of the photonics sector, this platform could penetrate a much broader commercial marketplace such as information technology, nanoelectronics and personalized low-cost consumer devices. The scientific and technological understanding created by developing this platform could enable businesses to leverage low-cost US-based nanomanufacturing to address markets for advanced materials and components around the world.


    This project will commercialize an innovative nanomanufacturing platform for producing diffractive optical elements (DOEs) with potential to reduce component cost and size.  Recently fiber-optic communications has expanded beyond its traditional function of long haul or backbone communications. Reducing the size, cost and complexity of optical components could allow DOEs to further expand their reach. Ideally the functionality of these components could be built right onto the end of an optical fiber. The proposed technology could allow true fiber-to-fiber components at a cost equal to or less than currently available optical components. It could further allow for sensing capabilities of "lab on a fiber" with the lab incorporated onto the end-face of a fiber. The project will focus on scaling the nanomanufacturing capability demonstrated during Phase I for end product prototype demonstrations that incorporate the DOEs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue the development of a family of new nanostructured conductive additives for use in high-performance coatings and composite resins. Static charge buildup from the environment is a critical problem in a number of vehicular applications, which increasingly utilize lightweight components constructed from non-conductive plastic or composite materials.  Static charge buildup interferes with electronic components, such as distributed sensors, so that mitigation of this effect is essential for safe vehicle operation. The design of lightweight vehicles using composite materials, which requires high-performing antistatic coatings, will lead to large reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions in transportation.  In 2011, emissions from transportation accounted for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Modern aircraft designs, utilizing composite materials, show more than 20% reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional vehicles.  Imminent increases in fuel efficiency standards in automobiles will also drive manufacturers to adopt the use of composite materials. The development of the proposed antistatic coatings is essential to enabling these new lightweight material technologies.

    The new additives are based on the synthesis of self-assembling nanostructures from conductive polymers and structure-directing agents. When successfully incorporated in commercial paints and primers, the conductive properties of the coating are enhanced without compromising adhesion and durability. In this Phase II effort, we will further optimize these additives, based on key customer requirements, and develop a plan to scale up their production tenfold with reduced waste and production time.  Corrosion properties for marine applications will also be evaluated, and the product portfolio will be expanded to address follow-on applications.

    platform that combines mobile interfaces and adaptive educational tablet applications
    (Apps) to support the needs of children with special needs. Tablet devices are
    known to provide an interactive experience that has revolutionized learning for
    children. Unfortunately, while these tablet devices are intuitive to utilize and
    easy for many children, those with disabilities are largely overlooked due to
    difficulties in effecting pinch-and-swipe gestures. This project thus addresses
    a direct need in our society by providing an integrated educational experience,
    focused on math education that addresses the diverse needs of children, while
    providing a solution for variations found in their disabilities. The contributions
    of this project include 1) the design of accessible math Apps usable by K-12 children
    with and without disabilities and 2) the design of apps that adapt educational
    content and provide feedback to parents and teachers based on real-time analytics.
    Given that there are over 93 million children worldwide living with a disability
    and, in the United States, children with disabilities are entitled to a free appropriate
    public education, there is a large potential of making both a commercial, as well
    as a societal, impact in this space.   \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project addresses
    an unmet need by developing an innovative solution to enable children with motor
    disabilities access to mobile devices and Apps that could engage them fully into

    Research Phase II project is a breakthrough in insect control for the agricultural
    industry. Provivi, Inc. intends to develop biosynthesis technology for producing
    insect pheromones, with a dramatic reduction in the cost of goods sold compared
    to existing syntheses. This will enable the use of pheromones beyond niche markets
    such as fruits and nuts: the target market for Provivi?s pheromone products are
    large acreage row crops. By introducing pheromone-based control as an inexpensive
    alternative in these markets, we are meeting a growing demand as conventional
    insecticides are becoming increasingly incapable of protecting crops due to insect
    resistance, regulatory constraints, and detrimental effects on beneficial insects.
    The societal and environmental benefits of using pheromones are numerous: pheromones
    are considered the safest possible insecticides with respect to human food consumption
    as well as environmental impact. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
    characterized them as low risk. Our pheromone products will benefit consumers
    by creating a safer food supply with lower chemical residues, growers by introducing
    an effective and novel pest control solution and the environment by reducing the

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project could be very significant for the field of light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other optoelectronics. This project is aimed at developing a solution based technology for depositing transparent conductive zinc oxide (ZnO) layers for use in LEDs and other optoelectronic devices. This ZnO deposition technology has potential to provide a lower cost and higher performance alternative to the physical vapor deposited indium tin oxide (PVD-ITO) layers that are currently used. The technology could be commercialized for LED manufacturing in only a few years. Lighting is one of the modern world's primary usages of energy and the adoption of high efficiency LED lighting has potential to significantly reduce lighting energy demand. By lowering manufacturing cost and improving performance, the technology developed in this project can help increase LED adoption and energy savings. In the longer term, this technology may also be used to lower manufacturing cost and improve performance of solar cells, impacting clean energy supply as well as demand.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at commercializing a technology which addresses the problem of Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) film performance and cost, in particular for light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other Gallium Nitride based optoelectronics. This proposal aims to bring a solution based method for depositing Zinc Oxide (ZnO) based TCO films to the point of commercial competiveness, with the longer term goal of providing significantly lower materials, energy, and capital equipment costs than current deposition methods and TCO materials. The approach being taken in the proposal relies on well understood characterization techniques as methods of determining successfulness as well as direct feedback from device manufacturers. The small business has the support and validation of strategic partnerships with device manufacturers eager to support this development of this technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses the issue that while mobile devices hold great promise for education, most of the kids' apps that claim to be educational ultimately amount to little more than brain candy. Furthermore, the few apps that are based on educational research are resource-intensive to develop and therefore have limited opportunity to scale their success. This project is building an educational platform that addresses the problems of both quality and scale in this market. It is creating a content enhancement system designed specifically for creating research-based educational content that allows developers and content studios to build mobile and web apps at a fraction (10%-20%) of the cost of traditional app development. The content built using this system is automatically integrated with analytics and personalization technology that tailors the content to each child based on the child's responses. The personalization technology applies methods from psychometrics and cognitive development to ensure that the content adapts to the child and facilitates learning in an engaging way. The project will deliver a large library of context-based and personalized learning content for preK and primary grades that parents know is based on sound research, and ultimately helps increase school readiness and learning outcomes. Given the growing demand for age-appropriate mobile educational content for children, this project has the potential to generate significant returns as a commercial enterprise and, importantly, through the economic gains resulting from improvements in educational outcomes. It will also give content developers the opportunity to economically develop and deploy new content that uses personalization technology, without having to build this complex technology themselves, thereby applying this innovation at a large scale.

    This SBIR Phase II project is building a mobile game-based learning platform to onboard high quality third-party children's educational content and enhance their effectiveness through analytics and personalization. To achieve this, the project is developing two significant technical innovations: (1) a cloud-based personalization engine that powers adaptive learning in varied educational contexts and (2) a content enhancement system to efficiently and economically enrich third-party children's content (in the form of digital assets, books, or videos) with interactive learning games that are powered by the personalization logic. The personalization engine will use machine learning techniques combined with statistical methods of psychometric assessment and principles from cognitive development. It will inconspicuously measure children's interaction with the proposed platform's educational content and dynamically adjust game-play to suit each user's individual skills, interests and educational needs. The proposed model of leveraging and augmenting the efforts of many content developers is a dramatic departure from existing content development paradigms in this space. The goal of the project is to substantially increase the scale and reach of personalized, research-based learning experiences on mobile devices and ultimately maximize the potential of modern technology to deliver dynamic learning experiences.

Yields from feedstock can be increased substantially, and CO2 gas produced from the fermentation, as a waste byproduct can instead be captured and assimilated into valuable chemicals, which translates into a significant improvement in yield and productivity for any applicable commodity or intermediate chemical production process. Consequently, the commercial and environmental implications of this innovative technological approach are tremendous. Furthermore, this project could significantly enhance scientific and technological understanding of microbial physiology and metabolism during gas and carbohydrate fermentation.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop and scale-up platform strains for C3 and C4 chemical production using carbon efficient pathways. The approach being developed is referred to as Anaerobic Non-Photosynthetic (ANP) mixotrophic fermentation, and process advancements will focus on bioreactor operation parameters, media formulations, and integration with product separation. By the end of this project, the project will likely have demonstrated and validated enhanced mass yield of C3 and/or C4 metabolite production at pilot-scale using ANP mixotrophic fermentation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be more effective and efficient use of unstructured data.  Limiting analysis to structured data ignores the massive amount of information in reports, memos, articles, and other written documents.  Workers require information on past work and ongoing projects, best practices, current events and competitor and customer activities.  However, companies with thousands of workers have millions of documents.  It is prohibitively expensive to index them manually so that they can be found, analyzed and acted on.  Moreover, overloaded workers do not have the time or training required to take on the task.  The problem is exacerbated by mergers and acquisitions.  In addition, over years, it is common for companies to accumulate large numbers of duplicate and out-of-date documents that workers do not take the time to rationalize and delete.  The result is inflated storage costs and reduced productivity as workers struggle to find the relevant, up-to-date information.  Inconsistent information governance also puts organizations at risk - litigation (retaining documents without legal or business value), safety (using out-of-date process safety management procedures) and operational (not leveraging best practices and lessons learned across the enterprise and beyond).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the problem that text documents - especially those internal to an organization - are very difficult to locate and analyze unless they are classified and tagged.  But manual classification and tagging are too expensive and inconsistent for large collections.  Large companies store many millions of documents.  And there is even more relevant information on the Web.  The objective of the proposed research to is to provide software assistants that classify documents into pre-specified categories, add tags to describe what each document is about, and the entities named in the documents (e.g., oilfields).  The assistants identify relevant documents and help people to learn of new developments by sending alerts when new documents of interest appear on the web or in the company's computers.  The primary technical result will be a suite of software assistants that companies can adopt singly or as an ensemble to help manage information sustainably.  These assistants build upon the proposed research to develop and integrate novel approaches to unsupervised machine learning, concept identification, and ontology construction.  They will enable companies to overcome major problems, including overload, finding relevant, up-to-date information, analyzing unstructured information, and identifying unneeded documents for elimination.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be to greatly enhance the capabilities of printed electronics via high performance conductive materials.  This will be accomplished by the development and commercialization of novel silver and copper ink chemistries that are used in a number of device applications ranging from display bezels and interconnects, to high performance OLED electrodes, to ink specifically developed for high speed printing and smart packaging applications.  The commercial impact of such developments will be the significant adoption and use of printed electronics material palettes across multiple consumer electronic device platforms.  This will ultimately lead to more efficient device manufacture with a simultaneous improvement in performance.  The printed electronics market is rapidly growing with progress hinging on fundamental material improvements.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate scalability of reactive silver ink chemistries, formulations for productization standards, and development of reactive copper ink chemistries.  The reactive silver ink chemistry has begun to receive significant traction with customers.  This program plans to achieve scalability of this high performance ink by novel purification of silver salts to achieve a high conductivity at large scales with industrially relevant processes.  Next the inks will need to adhere to specific productization standards.  This includes modifications of the chemistry for various printing processes ranging from low viscosity (10 cPs) up to high viscosities for high-volume printing techniques (1000 cPs and higher).  Also, modifications to the chemistry for various testing criteria such as adhesion, abrasion, and environmental tests such as humidity and heat cycling will be made.  Finally, reactive copper chemistries will be further developed.  Copper inks that can be processed thermally in the ambient environment represent both a significant challenge as well as a vast opportunity in the printed electronics market.  We have developed novel chemistries based on various low molecular weight reducing agents and short-chain surfactants that both reduce the copper quickly under thermal cycling while protecting the surface from oxidation.

    both qualitative and quantitative information about product quality in manufacturing,
    with an initial focus on contact lens manufacturing. Providing high-speed, industrial,
    micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions, GD-OCM enables contact lens
    manufacturers to replace multiple inspection steps with a single measurement done
    automatically, reducing the opportunity for damaging the samples and human error,
    and ultimately leading to increased productivity and yield.  The resulting improvements
    in contact lens performance and extended wear effects are poised to have a positive
    impact on a significant percentage of the population.  Recent evaluations of GD-OCM
    have indicated its ability to provide a new wealth of characterization methods
    for quality control of various materials that are otherwise impossible to characterize
    nondestructively, including gradient refractive index polymers, glass and layered
    structures.  Additionally, GD-OCM will enable new advances in a wide variety of

    provide micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions and quantification
    of yield-relevant contact lens quality metrics not previously available in a single
    instrument; and 2) demonstration of the technology for inspection in a production
    environment to rapidly and accurately monitor defects and quantify contact lens
    quality using product relevant metrics. This nondestructive, on-line optical inspection
    system can have significant impact not only on the process control and thereby
    yield of contact lenses, but also in manufacturing of layered materials in general,

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to discover digital methods to personalize reading instruction such that students understand more when they read, retain knowledge, and build lasting skills. The academic research on reading supports the claim that active reading strategies that incorporate quality instruction can benefit students. However, instruction is usually not personalized to meet the needs of specific students, and even when an educator works 1:1 with a student they can only interpret a limited number of signals from a student to help guide instruction. The objective of the project is to take in several inputs when students read digitally and investigate whether personalized reading instruction can effectively be created and delivered such that students get extra help when they struggle and are challenged when they can succeed on their own. Two-thirds of students in the U.S. are struggling readers; they cannot understand the main idea when they read. These students are four times more likely to drop out of school. People who read critically have more success in school, obtain high quality jobs, and are able to contribute more to expand social resources. Researchers and educators have been trying to solve the "reading gap" for decades, but only now does the technology exist to make this possible.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use unique machine learning techniques to personalize reading instruction. The algorithms to personalize instruction will ensure that extra help, or scaffolding, is allocated to the students who need it, and removed when they no longer need it or when it threatens to become a crutch. This approach is different than other machine learning algorithms, which are built to minimize the overall error or maximize the overall reward. However, what is required for personalized reading instruction is different. The algorithm must learn how much to help a student not so they perform better with help, but so they perform better without it because the goal is for students to become better readers in the long term, not become reliant on scaffolding to read. The objective of the research is to fully develop and commercialize this personalized reading system and will involve data science, application development, and content authoring.

    for web-based learning materials, called structured student-guided adaptive (SSGA)
    techniques. In contrast to some recent adaptive commercial products, SSGA preserves
    the ability of an instructor to maintain a structured path through the material,
    which is critical for keeping students in synch with lecture/discussion sessions,
    for enabling students to study with classmates, and more. Adaptivity comes in
    several forms, including auto-generating successively-harder problems based on
    correct completion of earlier problems, with explanations and source material
    carefully integrated to ensure students learn underlying concepts. Also, the adaptivity
    is in part guided by the student, who can choose to start with simpler or harder
    problems, or can auto-generate self-quizzes based on performance, selected material,
    and more. In contrast with other products, student-guided adaptivity gives students
    appropriate control over their learning, yielding a sense of empowerment and reducing
    anxiety that can inhibit learning. The project builds the authoring platform necessary
    to support SSGA material creation, building upon a previously-developed authoring
    framework for interactive web material. The project also creates new material
    for college algebra and statistics courses, whose high attrition rates can be
    reduced by replacing traditional textbooks/homework with SSGA material."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are both technical and economic. The developed error-correction solutions will enable flash-memory-based devices to have higher capacities, higher reliability, and faster speeds at lower power while driving down the cost. This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems.  The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs.  Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware.  The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs.

    were photonic crystal structures consisting of regularly repeating, orderly lattices
    of dielectric materials. It was generally assumed that crystal order was essential
    to have photonic bandgaps. This longstanding assumption is now known to be false.
    New photonic bandgap structures, characterized by suppressed density fluctuations
    (hyperuniformity), include disordered structures that are isotropic. This means
    that light propagates the same way through the photonic solid independent of direction
    (which is impossible for a photonic crystal). While the layout of waveguides in
    conventional photonic crystal  and quasi crystal photonic bandgap materials is
    tightly-constrained to follow characteristic crystal axes, the layout rules for
    hyper uniform disordered solid waveguides have no such fundamental constraints.
    The universal protocol and highly-efficient computational framework covering the
    full range of photonic crystal, quasi crystal , and hyper uniform disordered solid-based
    photonic bandgaps will be generalized to a broad class of critically important
    photonic components by the application of a powerful new gradient-free optimization

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a novel phosphor material system that drives up to a 20% improvement in energy efficiency of phosphor-converted LEDs (pcLEDs) over current state-of-the-art phosphor material systems in nearly all pcLED applications. The market for LED phosphors in 2012 was roughly $500 million and is expected to reach $1.2 billion by 2016. The 20% improvement in the packaged LED efficiency will also trigger a cascade of tangible impacts at the end-product system level such as using fewer LEDs, increasing efficacy (lumens per watt) and mobile device battery life, reducing electronic driver complexity, reducing heat, a thinner form factor, and a far more brilliant color gamut. The anticipated results from this grant will satisfy the 2020 goals for down-converting materials laid out in the U.S. Department of Energy's 2013 Multi-Year Program Plan, bringing these efficacy and efficiency goals and standards to market four years ahead of schedule.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to further develop a novel and proprietary phosphor material system for use in phosphor-converted light-emitting diode (pcLED) applications that will improve pcLED efficacy up to 20%. In display backlighting, 20-40% of the light emitted by the state-of-the-art phosphors miss the sweet spot of the display's color filters resulting in unused light and wasted energy. Similarly, in general lighting approximately 15% of the emitted light falls outside the visible spectrum, again resulting in wasted energy. The technology developed is a phosphor material utilizing a novel chemistry that exhibits a narrow light emission spectrum to increase LED brightness and energy efficiency by 10-20% in display backlighting and up to 15% in general lighting applications. Prototype materials have been synthesized that exhibit a narrow emission peak at target wavelengths, and the next steps include optimization and characterization of the most effective compositions. The anticipated results of this project are narrow-band phosphor materials that exhibit performance and reliability characteristics commensurate with industry standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly lowering the cost of high precision glass molding through a low-cost carbide-bonded graphene coating. In optical industry, optical glasses have been the de facto choice. These lenses are used in cameras, projection systems and military equipment. However, cost and other considerations frequently lead to the choice of injection molded plastic lenses with their acceptable but lower image quality. The innovative carbide-bonded graphene coatings are both low cost and durable, and could allow use of precision optical glasses in places where plastic products are used today. The coatings also have the potential to spread to other markets such as advanced thermal management, next generation electronic components, and biosensors based on the unique combination of excellent mechanical, physical, optical transparency and biocompatibility properties together with tunable optoelectronic characteristics. Such products may greatly improve our daily lives in areas such as portable electronics and optics, energy saving and green manufacturing.


    This project will further advance the chemically vapor deposited carbide-bonded graphene coating process demonstrated during Phase I that involved using silicon wafers with micro/nano-patterning. With the help of our industrial partners we now intend to scale the technology to the commercial level.  The process development is targeted to developing low-cost and mass-producible high precision glass molding, micro-optics, and NIR aspheric optics for cell phones and high performance laser collimators. These activities would also enhance our understanding of carbide-bonded graphene coating technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aligns with a major shift in healthcare to reduce hospital acquired infections. At a cost of over $1.5B and 600,000 extra hospital days in the US alone, surgical wound infection in high-risk abdominal surgery patients is a major healthcare burden. In addition, providers and hospitals face greater scrutiny of their wound infection rates today, and the sweeping changes of healthcare reform have incentivized these critical stakeholders to invest in preventative solutions. However, currently available solutions are insufficient, and existing surgical device companies have not developed a compelling pipeline of products to address this unmet need. The proposed technology enjoys a competitive advantage in that it operates in a relatively open competitive landscape, and its unique mechanism of action provides a comprehensive wound protection strategy. Thus, this technology has the potential to make a significant worldwide impact on wound infection, both from a healthcare quality and commercialization standpoint. The initial market for this technology is in colorectal surgery, with ample expansion opportunities into other abdominal surgical markets totaling over $1 billion.


    The proposed project seeks to develop and commercialize a novel technology designed to prevent one of the most frequent, morbid, and costly hospital-acquired infections: surgical wound infection. The technology is an innovative surgical tool that provides a comprehensive anti-contamination strategy for the wound that is also user-friendly for the surgeon. This device has the potential to be a transformative innovation in the quality of surgical care, particularly in the 3.5 million patients undergoing high-risk abdominal-gastrointestinal (GI) surgery in whom wound infections are the most common. The technology also allows surgeons to experiment with a variety of approaches to identify ?best practices? for intraoperative wound care. This Phase II project proposes three main objectives. First, the company will refine the scientific understanding of the local and systemic therapeutic of the anti-contamination therapy through numerical modeling and pre-clinical testing in a porcine model in order to provide clinical use recommendations. Second, the company will design and develop a product sized for laparoscopic surgeries in order to support a broad-based commercialization effort. Third, the company with develop scaled manufacturing capability to support commercial release of the CleanCision product platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is very significant.  Current peptide-based drugs constitute important tools in human healthcare, and development of new peptide-based drugs represents a growing proportion of the pharmaceutical research effort.  Current peptide drugs addressing widespread diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and osteoporosis have sales above $1 billion.  These drugs must be delivered by injection.  This SBIR aims for new drugs with comparable heath benefits that can be taken in pill form, because the convenience of oral delivery, relative to injection, would rapidly capture most of the market.  The high stability engendered by our design strategy should enable drug development for diseases that currently cannot be treated.  Thus, the commercial potential of this project is high.  Orally delivered replacements for injectable drugs would have a substantial broader impact because they would enhance patient compliance.  Inadequate treatment of T2DM for example, leads to adverse health consequences that degrade productivity and quality of life for patients.  Increased compliance resulting from a general ability to deliver peptide drugs in pill form would vastly improve outcomes for patients, including the specific patients populations targeted by our current programs.


                The proposed project is motivated by fundamental questions about the way drug molecules are processed in the human body.  Drug candidates cannot address a human disease unless they reach the appropriate sites within the body and then persist in those sites.  The proposed research focuses on a particular class of bioactive compounds called "peptides."  Peptides can act in powerful and favorable ways within the body, with high specificity of action (which minimizes "side effects"), but they are subject to very rapid destruction after administration.  This weakness of peptides requires that they be injected regularly, but peptide drugs would be much more useful if they could be taken orally.  This SBIR Phase I project examines unique peptide-like molecules that are designed to retain the favorable pharmaceutical action of peptides themselves but to resist degradation mechanisms within the body that rapidly destroy peptides.  The stomach is the most destructive site for peptides, and this project aims to generate peptide-like molecules that are sufficiently robust to survive the stomach and reach the small intestine, where they can be absorbed.  Achieving these molecular design goals would have high intellectual merit in addition to advancing drug design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in detecting sepsis early in its course, before end organ damage when it is most treatable. Sepsis, an uncontrolled systemic response to local infection by bacteria or fungi, is responsible for more deaths than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined and is associated with ~$17B in annual U.S. healthcare expenditures. We anticipate that providing emergency department physicians with an earlier diagnostic will profoundly influence clinical outcomes (currently ~40% mortality), costs (>$22,000/case), and the quality of life for survivors and their families. Accumulating evidence connects systemic immune activation ? a key process in sepsis ? with single-cell architectural changes that are mechanically measured by high-speed mechanical phenotyping technology. This technology is well-suited for adult sepsis screening in the emergency department (market size of $1.5B) due to: (1) the functional analysis of cell state the mechanical measurement provides, (2) its high achievable throughput and therefore statistical accuracy, (3) exceedingly short turnaround time, (4) low cost of goods, and (5) the clinically-actionable information it provides. Beyond the adult sepsis screening market, several additional indications include neonatal sepsis, bladder cancer detection, academic research tools, and drug development.


    The proposed project brings an innovative new class of biomarkers to bear on a problem that has been intractable with current biomarkers.  Briefly, the physical properties of cells have been known to be important for decades, but only with the advent of breakthrough microfluidic technology have we been able to measure these parameters in a high-throughput manner capable of diagnosing disease.  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II award will be used to develop and validate innovative sample preparation and image analysis modules for a sepsis screening technology as well as performance of proof-of-concept clinical studies that would be a flagship offering in using biomechanical biomarkers to diagnose disease. The technical objectives are designed to improve sensitivity to white blood cells, activated during sepsis, by microfluidic automation of sample preparation and optimization of the microscopic imaging optics. In addition to preparing the test for practical implementation in the emergency department, the test will be validated with a proof-of-concept clinical study, and a clinical scoring system will be devised.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase the efficiency of identifying, mapping, and remediating water sources contaminated with chlorinated solvents.  Chlorinated solvents are used in vast quantities as solvents and degreasing agents, and in the dry cleaning industry. The necessity of monitoring chlorinated solvents in water will continue for many generations due to their widespread occurrence in water sources around the world, their toxicity, and their high stability. A significant need exists and will grow for devices that can continuously measure the concentration of chlorinated organic chemicals in water, and that can do so accurately and inexpensively. Continuous in-situ data production in the field of environmental sensing will greatly increase efficiency in all processes that require a measurement of these chemicals, having a significant impact on the costs and timelines associated with remediation of contaminated sites. This sensor will allow for continuous monitoring of possible contamination sources in the case of a contamination event. Also, it will afford easy profiling of contamination plumes in aquifers. This technology will replace the current laboratory-based measurement protocols, which are not readily adapted for in-situ, on-line, or in-the-field measurements, and cannot produce data continuously.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop an optical enzymatic biosensor for continuous, quantitative monitoring of chlorinated solvent concentrations in water. Chlorinated solvent contamination of groundwater is a widespread ongoing issue around the world. The biosensing concept will be implemented in an optical fiber format, in which optical biosensor tips are linked to a small electro-optical unit. Analyte detection takes place on biosensor tips that are coated with enzymes and fluorescent chemicals. The scope of the research includes two parallel strategies for obtaining highly stable detection enzymes such that long lifetime sensors are achievable, development of a system to deliver required reagents to the sensing tip, development of signal processing algorithms to enable high accuracy measurements in variable environmental conditions and speciation of chlorinated compounds within mixtures, a manufacturing study for high throughput fabrication of the sensors, and field testing of the device at multiple contamination sites. Attainment of these objectives will advance the sensing technology to a robust and readily manufactured system for chlorinated solvent monitoring with low detection limits, high accuracy, and reliability.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at reducing the impact of knee arthritis and improving the quality of life for those suffering from this debilitating condition, while simultaneously strengthening the bond between academia and industry by providing students with unique research opportunities through the development of a novel Total Knee Replacement technology.  Over 600,000 total knee replacement procedures are performed annually, comprising 8% of all Medicare spending.  Total hospital charges for this procedure approached $40 billion for 2012.  The revision rates for this procedure are significant: 10% at 10 years and 20% at 20 years.  Considering the aging population of the United States, the number of total knee replacements and revisions are steadily increasing and the majority of these will be completed under Medicare coverage.  The primary cause for revision surgery is loosening of the implants.  This innovation aims to develop an anchoring method for implantable orthopedic devices that will reduce the total number of revision procedures performed by creating a more stable interface between the bone and the device, and therefore enhance the scientific and technological understanding of orthopedic implants in general.

    The proposed project is a device that utilizes structural engineering principles such as load transfer and truss design to improve osteo-incorporation of a total knee replacement implant; such a device is likely to be more efficacious than current designs.  Currently available systems suffer from significant revision rates after being implanted only a short while.  With younger patients receiving these implants, devices need to be developed that will give the mobility and quality of life required by these patients.  The novel web structure fixing the tibial tray of a total knee replacement into the bone should provide improved initial fixation, reduce micro-motion, and eliminate aseptic loosening, all of which contribute towards a reduced revision rate and improved patient comfort.  After using the information gained from the Phase I SBIR investigation to inform computational models, the design of this device will be finalized.  The device will then be subjected to rigorous mechanical testing to investigate its performance in vivo, while simultaneously serving to satisfy the testing requirements mandatory for FDA approval.

    Use of our technology will have a significant societal impact by providing more

    require frequent dosing because they do not last long in the body and/or require
    delivery via a needle into the vein because they are not available to the body
    when given as an injection into the skin. We are developing a way to modify peptides
    so that they can last longer in the body. As an example, current treatments for
    a cardiopulmonary rare disease only serve to alleviate symptoms. In this project,
    a novel peptide that has the potential to be a breakthrough therapeutic for this
    rare disease will be modified to improve the delivery profile. Current data suggests
    that the new therapy will be multifaceted and would treat the underlying disease.
    The objective of this study is to advance the platform technology by exploring
    other types of modifications, then test these modifications in vitro and in vivo
    to compare which modifications confer the best delivery profile. A lead compound
    will be chosen to explore efficacy in animal models, and to examine the immunogenicity
    and toxicity in rodents to generate critical early safety data. The outcome of
    SBIR Phase II will be a long-acting peptide therapeutic with strong in vivo preclinical
    efficacy data for the treatment of a rare disease that has an acceptable safety
    profile and is ready for further preclinical development."

    is compromised.  Almost all patients lose the ability to swallow as they near
    death. Approximately 10%-20% of hospice patients have severe symptoms after the
    oral route is no longer functional. Unfortunately most of these patients either
    die uncomfortably, or are admitted to the hospital for symptom control.  These

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will have immediate value for the pharmaceutical industry by accelerating research and discovery of new drugs, and also increasing production efficiency and safety. The technology also is applicable in many other sectors; e.g., monitoring natural polymers, such as dissolution of gelatin used in food or pharmaceutical applications, flocculation of impurities by water purification polymers, entrapment of oil by surfactants and other agents used in combating oil spills, and more.  The quantitative kinetics of molecular weight changes during all these processes will allow deeper understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical forces that drive them. Therefore, many commercial and scientific opportunities exist for the proposed technology, yielding the potential for significant impact across multiple industries. With demonstrated feasibility on applications in protein therapeutics and early adoption by several key users, the initial market for this technology and instrumentation could expand quickly, and sales could reach $10M within several years of delivering a commercial product.  The overall market for the technology will increase in time as other application sectors are developed.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a new technology for monitoring aggregation in therapeutic protein solutions, which will have wide-ranging impact in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Protein aggregation is a major problem across these sectors engaged in developing new protein pharmaceuticals. Protein aggregation can elicit immune responses against the protein itself, severely reduce bioavailability, and is a significant hurdle in the drug development pipeline. This new technology can simultaneously and quantitatively monitor the stability of many independent protein formulations for hours, days, months, or longer, all under the control of a single instrument and without any significant human intervention.  Because the technology is based on laser light scattering, it provides a rigorous means of monitoring the protein aggregation process.  It is based on fundamental laws of physics, and not on empirical or inferential means. The implementation and use of this technology could revolutionize drug discovery, formulation, and quality control dimensions and accelerate development of new drugs while making existing ones safer and more efficiently produced.  The technology can be used wherever proteins are under development for fighting diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and various forms of cardiovascular disease.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from its potential to transform professional networking from passive to pro-active. People-information is valuable for business professionals in sales, marketing, recruiting, fundraising, M&A and business development, to establish connections, generate leads, and generally maximize opportunities.  This project will further commercialize big data analysis techniques to quickly capture, filter, and analyze people related information from the whole Internet, and present such information to users via mobile and web services for various use cases such as networking at events, etc.  These services will enable mobile users to plan in advance whom they should meet at events, and equip them with much deeper insights regarding their prospects than are currently available, so that they can generate business more efficiently.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is intended to further develop and commercialize the company's big data analysis and mining technology for people-information, with specific emphasis on making professional networking at events/meetings more productive and efficient. It provides a real-time, instant, "people research" capability on mobile devices to enable effective networking at business events, trade shows, conferences and private/Meetup meetings. It goes beyond existing "name-based" keyword search provided by commonly-used search engines, and is complementary to social network sites, which rely purely on subjective information provided by users themselves. Based on the company's current collaboration with large event organizers and their marketing/sales teams, the project will further extend the event mobile solution for enterprise customers by providing an organizer self-service (SaaS) platform, integrating with their CRMs, and leveraging Beacon technology to track attendee activities and interests in trade shows. In addition, it will include more advanced features to motivate individual users to use the app more frequently, including outside such events. Finally, it will build a platform with APIs to allow OEM partners to generate and use the people-information in activities such as recruiting, marketing, etc.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to wherever headphones are used to listen to sound. The first commercial markets targeted by the technology being developed are gaming, virtual reality and consumer entertainment. These are areas in which the US has strong market and technology leads. By the end of the project, the company intends to have developed software that can be licensed to major players in these areas, reaching tens of millions of users. Beyond these markets, there are many applications for spatial audio in human-computer interfaces to deliver spatial information along with the intended semantic message. Several niche markets also exist, such as data presentation/exploration via sonification and specifically designed auditory interfaces for vision-impaired users. Overall it is expected that the proposed R&D work will advance the state of the art in science and technology and will be of substantial value to society as a whole due to high usability, fidelity, naturalness, and portability of the developed spatial audio solutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop highly realistic and computationally efficient software for synthesis of personalized spatial audio, for applications that include virtual reality, gaming, and prostheses for the blind. Current algorithms are either perceptually unsatisfactory or have very high computational load. Approximate modeling of sound propagation, reverberation, and diffusion, along with tradeoffs between complexity and quality, will be explored using perceptual distortion metrics combined with the skills of professional listeners. The software will be optimized for use on mobile, console and embedded platforms. Additionally, a method to personalize the software to individual listeners, which was previously developed and tested in laboratory conditions, will be further refined and ruggedized for use in realistic environments. The expected outcomes will include a high-quality and efficient audio rendering library, a portable personalization apparatus, and several demonstrations that highlight the capabilities of the technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in addressing the novel hardware challenges of energy and speed associated with big data applications. The electronics industry is quickly transforming from a compute-centric model to a data-centric model, where the key to success in the market place is the ability to store, manipulate and access large amounts of data in a fast and energy-efficient manner.  The existing memory technologies cannot meet these challenges. This changing landscape offers a major potential for emerging memory technologies that can successfully address these new emerging demands.  The Electric-Field-Controlled Nonvolatile Magnetic Memory technology developed under this project offers the most viable low-cost, low-power, and high-endurance solution to these new demands. Conservative estimates project a rapid growth in the emerging memory technologies market, reaching $2B in 2018. We expect that Electric-Field-Controlled Nonvolatile Magnetic Memory will be able to capture a significant part of this emerging market. More broadly, it can be used in many general computing and information processing systems, and hence it can potentially impact a major part of the $300B semiconductors industry by enabling ultra-low power green and instant-on electronic systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on the development of prototype Electric-Field-Controlled Nonvolatile Magnetic Memory chips and arrays.  This memory technology uses a fundamentally new way to write information into the nonvolatile memory bits, providing major advantages in terms of power dissipation, cost, density, and scalability. This project will result in chip prototypes, providing significant advantages in terms of energy efficiency, density, and scalability when compared to alternative existing or emerging memory technologies. They also provide virtually unlimited endurance.  Circuit design for memory product development will also be performed, as well as modeling in support of circuit development and device optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to accelerate the pace of microbe development for the biomanufacture of valuable proteins, advanced enzymes for industry, or therapeutic medicines. DNA cloning is an everyday practice in the course of both industrial- and university-based research. Cloning technology has remained largely unchanged for the last 20 years.  As a consequence, researchers consume a significant amount of time and money designing and constructing DNA, rather than on designing and conducting experiments. Over the past few years, standardized experimental DNA construction methods have been developed that lend themselves well to automation and rapid assembly of DNA. Process automation is progressing from luxury to necessity, as target applications demand the fabrication of large combinatorial DNA libraries in the search for better antibodies, faster enzymes, and more productive microbial strains. The proposed technology will allow rapid forward engineered biological libraries of recombinant DNA. The commercial availability of this technology will provide a low cost alternative to current methods.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a bioCAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing) technology that enables rapid DNA assembly for synthetic biology. Wedding recent advances in DNA assembly methods, and the software algorithms used to design those DNA assemblies, the proposed research will result in a platform technology for facilitating an optimized combination of direct synthesis and DNA assembly to make large combinatorial libraries.   After the construction of the DNA libraries, screening for constructs with the desired activity remains a major scale-limiting bottleneck, both in terms of cost and time.  The proposed technology will allow rapid prototyping and characterization of forward engineered biological libraries of recombinant DNA, proteins, or whole cells.  The goal is to commercialize an easy-to-use platform for assembling complex constructs onto vector backbones, transfecting them into host microbes, and doing a rapid assessment of product yield.  Results are captured, saved, and returned to a design database after data cleansing and analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase the competitiveness of U.S. semiconductor industry by improving the quality of A/MS design verification, improving first pass design success and reducing time-to-market. Today, current analog verification methods and tools often fail to catch design mistakes, especially due to unforeseen interactions across chip subsystems, and these mistakes are a frequent cause of costly delays in bringing products to market even on chips where analog is only a small portion of the overall design ? a $63 billion market. The costs and lost profit potential related to multiple design versions can quickly run to millions of dollars and easily dwarfs the cost of providing designers access to the appropriate design tools. Using two different market analyses, the first using a digital verification market analogy and the second considering worldwide new (not slight derivatives) designs in just the AMS IC market, leads to an estimation of total available market for new analog verification solutions of $300 million annual revenue. Further extending the verification solutions with analytics and collaboration tools can potentially increase the market by a further 50% to $450 million annual revenue. Understanding A/MS verification coverage is a key component of this opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes a verification coverage system for analog/mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuit development. Verification of today?s complex integrated circuits and systems is widely acknowledged as a critical challenge to improving design productivity. Part of the verification challenge revolves around understanding what portion of the operating space has been examined; i.e., ?covered?. Today well-accepted formal and simulation-based techniques exist to capture and measure test coverage for digital integrated circuits, but there is no corresponding commercial capability for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Analog designers frequently spend too much time analyzing and over-testing system behavior for a small set of well understood usage scenarios while leaving significant portions of the state-space completely untested. The design exploration problem for A/MS circuits presents a critical challenge for implementing such systems due to the inherently large design space associated with these types of circuits. Key objectives for the project include productizing and extending key components demonstrated in the Phase 1 prototype. This project will deliver a commercial product to provide A/MS verification coverage data that is actionable and facilitates collaboration between design and verification teams. The resulting product will have scalability and performance to handle large complex designs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the delivery of a custom-made nipple made from a patient's own cells for women who have had a mastectomy due to breast cancer.   In the US about 300,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer annually and nearly 40% will undergo mastectomies, full removal of the breast.  A third of them will opt for breast reconstruction, most of whom will desire a nipple.  Patients with loss of the nipple areola complex (NAC) from cancer treatments continue to experience psychological distress long after breast mound reconstruction has taken place, yet currently available options for nipple reconstruction are vulnerable to an unpredictable degree of loss of nipple projection, symmetry, color and possible need for reoperation.  The technology can be evolved to treat other unmet needs in reconstruction and the cosmetic surgery field. The technology in this project can contribute to the scientific knowledge fundamental to the fields of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine. The results of this research will help the field move towards larger, clinically relevant tissues and potentially the creation of whole organs.

    This project will investigate, develop tools and techniques, and select best formulation for the ultimate delivery of a graft that has been tissue engineered to address the lack of reconstructive solutions for women that have undergone mastectomies and desire nipple reconstruction.   The research aims of the Phase II project will demonstrate further  viability of the scientific concepts proposed, such as impact of vascularization on volume retention, and develop tools/techniques for engineering shaped adipose tissue constructs (relevant to nipple projection).  The project will test and select best formulation for adipose constructs as measured by in vivo volume retention, host reaction and vascular infusion.   The research proposes to further optimize size and projection parameters and develop methods to assess and characterize incoming materials to reproducibly fabricate constructs with the correct size and desired volume retention.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is as part of a broader plan to develop, validate, and market this new surgical device across a broad spectrum of surgeries involving internal incisions (a total of 10 million procedures annually in the U.S. alone). This technology has particular value in the rapidly-growing minimally-invasive surgery market, in which internal closure is made difficult by the small size of superficial incisions. These markets represent more than 6 million surgeries per year in the U.S., creating a domestic market potential of more than $2.5 billion for the platform of closure devices under development. Initially, the system directly addresses a specific unmet clinical need: reducing both the technical demands of internal closure during minimally-invasive hysterectomy and the significant complications associated with the use of sutures in this procedure. There were approximately 420,000 of these surgeries performed in the U.S. in 2013, representing more two-thirds of all U.S. hysterectomies. This fraction of hysterectomies performed in this manner is continuing to grow, and will represent a total annual addressable domestic market size at peak sales of $200 MM ($600 MM globally).

    The proposed project develops a novel surgical closure system for closing internal incisions in endoscopy. Our initial application is in laparoscopic (minimally-invasive) hysterectomy. Sutures are typically used to close internal incisions in laparoscopic surgery. Throwing loops and tying knots are among the most difficult parts of laparoscopic procedures; these difficulties have slowed the adoption of laparoscopic hysterectomy. In Phase II, the Technical Objectives are (1) to refine the closure system to meet the requirements of a minimum viable product; (2) to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the system in a large animal model of laparoscopic hysterectomy; and (3) to demonstrate efficacy of the system in laparoscopic hysterectomy in a cadaveric model. These objectives are designed to complete the evaluation of the performance of this novel closure system against product requirements identified by the surgical community and utilized in the design process.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from it enabling (i) faster and more
    productive computer software and (ii) a significant improvement in the ability
    to counter cyber threats. Many enterprises, such as financial firms and online
    retailers, operate software platforms that are central to their business. Even
    a few minutes of reduced platform performance can lead to financial losses in
    the millions of dollars. The first project outcome will enable enterprises to
    automatically detect and rapidly resolve such performance problems, leading to
    more efficient information systems, more satisfied consumers and more profitable
    companies. The second outcome will boost the defenses of our nation's computers
    against cyber-attacks. President Obama recently cited cyber threats as one of
    our most serious economic and national security challenges. Losses from theft
    of intellectual property are estimated to cost American companies around $250
    Billion annually. The company's malware analysis technology will detect some of
    the most advanced attacks that defeat today's defenses, leading to safer consumer
    and enterprise data, and reducing financial losses. Overall the company's technology
    enhances the technical understanding of binary code, an important class of software
    employed in a range of enterprise software and most modern cyber-attacks. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a software tool
    called a binary rewriter that can understand and modify binary code. Although
    software applications are developed in human-readable programming languages, a
    large fraction is translated to binary code to be executed on hardware. Binary
    code is difficult to understand and modify. In addition, modern sophisticated
    techniques such as packing - employed by malware writers - further complicate
    this task. The intellectual merit of the project is based around the development
    of a novel binary rewriting mechanism that fulfills critical requirements that
    cannot be simultaneously achieved by any existing rewriting tool. The new rewriting
    mechanism will be able to reliably rewrite every binary program, including programs
    containing sophisticated techniques such as packing, without compromising the
    critical requirement for low run-time and memory overhead. It will also provide
    a novel mechanism for (i) monitoring the performance of enterprise applications
    as part of an advanced performance monitoring framework; and (ii) detecting, and
    therefore providing a means to stop, infection from evasive malware, a sophisticated
    class of malware that deliberately hides its malicious behavior."

    excitonic character of molecular and organic semiconductors that lead to oscillator
    bunching to produce photovoltaic architectures with selective absorption, i.e.
    exhibiting visible minima and ultra-violet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) maxima,
    uniquely distinct from the band-absorption of traditional inorganic semiconductors.
    By using excitonic molecular semiconductors with structured absorption in the
    UV/NIR these devices are simultaneously optimized for high power conversion efficiency,
    visible light transmission, and color rendering index."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project goal is to produce GaSb photovoltaic devices of multicell (MIM) construction for TPV use.   Current devices use single cell.  MIM devices have significant advantages over single cell in efficiency and cost. A MIM device is composed of many sub-cells physically isolated on the same substrate.  This proportionally increases output voltage and decreases output current resulting in lower internal power loss.   To date there have been no publications describing MIM Ge or GaSb  MIM devices.  The Phase I Program demonstrated that high lifetime GaSb can be epitaxially grown on semi insulating GaAs and an IR&D program demonstrated that 50 subcell MIM devices can be fabricated from epitaxial germanium on semi insulating GaAs.  Combining these elements will produce an ideal device. Although the Ge MiM is suitable for TPV a GaSb MIM would give a three to tenfold improvement in performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to economically & efficiently recover waste heat as electricity.  57% of all power generated in the US is rejected as waste heat, however, to date there have been no successful attempts to recover this heat as electricity as opposed to steam for heating purposes. MTPV is developing a thermophotovoltaic solution to address this problem and is a pioneer in the use of near-field evanescent coupling to dramatically increase the power density obtainable from a heat source at a given temperature.   MTPV has published a clear demonstration of this phenomenon and is engaged in commercializing its use.    Silicon emitter chips designed to transfer energy from a heat source in such a manner as to facilitate the formation of a sub-micron gap are currently being produced in a foundry as well as both single cell and MIM Ge devices.  The unique housing that is required to contain these chips and allow insertion into an 1100 degree C furnace is designed/ fabricated at MTPV?s facility where power generation tests are conducted.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will use waste methane gas (biogas) as a feedstock to produce pellets of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a valuable polymer that is converted into a variety of high margin or high volume, eco-friendly plastic products such as childrens toys, electronic casings, water bottles, and food packaging containers. The current plastics market is dominated by petroleum-derived, non-biodegradable, energy-intensive plastics, which often persist in the environment upon disposal. Alternative plastics are derived from rapidly renewable biological resources (biobased) and consumed by microbes when no longer needed (biodegradable). Unfortunately, these alternative plastics are often costly to produce and  their  manufacturing  process  requires  significant  amounts  of  energy.  Mango Materials has a novel, patented, energy-efficient method to produce a biodegradable, biobased polymer at a price competitive with petrochemical-based polymers.  Phase II involves scaling the Mango Materials process to produce samples for customers to test while addressing associated challenges. Key goals are to optimize the production process and to verify that customers can process the product on existing manufacturing equipment. Key results include a more optimized process, customer validation of samples, a thorough understanding of polymer characteristics, and an updated cost and yield comparison.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will ultimately be the widespread production of low-cost bioplastics from waste biogas and the eventual displacement of petroleum-based  plastics.  Bioplastics  have  the  potential  to  capture  an  increasing fraction of the plastics market, thereby giving consumers the choice to purchase affordable, environmentally friendly, bioplastic-based products. When products made from Mango Materials bioplastic are disposed in modern wastewater treatment plants or landfills, they biodegrade anaerobically (without oxygen) to methane. This methane can be cycled back and re-enter the process as feedstock to produce more PHA.  Thus, the life cycle may be closed, creating a cradle to cradle system. This use of biogas will provide a strong economic incentive for facilities to capture their methane, rather than releasing or flaring it, which will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and reduce corresponding impacts on global warming. The innovation will enhance scientific understanding by studying the production of bioplastic from waste biogas and by characterizing the microbial species responsible for this conversion. This project represents one of the first times that waste biogas will be used commercially as a feedstock for bacteria to produce a valuable product.

    \ aims  to  develop  a prototype 3-D imaging sensor for high temperature furnaces
    used in the glass industry. These furnaces are also used in many other industries,
    including cement, coke, iron & steel, and pulp & paper industries. This 3-D imaging
    sensor creates an interior image of the furnace wall so that maintenance personnel
    can identify wall erosion, and any molten material leaking through the wall joints.
    \ The objective in Phase II is to develop a prototype sensor system that can form
    3-D images of the interface between the furnace wall and molten glass. To achieve
    this, a high performance sensor hardware and corresponding imaging software will
    be developed. The entire prototyped system will be tested on high temperature
    furnace walls using in-house kilns followed by tests at an operational glass furnace.
    \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will enable
    maintenance programs based upon real furnace conditions.  This will allow longer
    life span of high temperature furnaces and the ability to make informed local
    maintenance without a major interruption in production. This translates to significant
    financial savings for the glass manufacturing industry and improved safety, as
    several catastrophic accidents have occurred due to molten glass leaking from
    the furnaces.  The sensor technology also offers a platform on which many other
    applications can be built, including microwave medical imaging, archaeology explorations,
    and defect detection inside refractories during manufacturing."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, intraoperative imaging
    technology to address the problem of inadvertent cuts to vasculature during minimally
    invasive surgeries. More than 17% of patients who undergo these types of in-patient
    surgeries suffer from an intraoperative bleeding event. When a vessel is injured,
    there is a higher probability of hospital borne infection due to the loss of blood,
    and the added cost of care per patient increases by thousands of dollars due to
    corrective action and extended length of stay for the patient. The risk of vascular
    injury is compounded by risk factors, such as obesity, which limit the surgeon's
    ability to visualize and navigate vasculature. Therefore, there is a critical
    need to identify and assess hidden vasculature in real time. The proposed technology
    helps identify blood vessel before a cut is made. Importantly, this system will
    be designed for seamless integration into a suite of surgical instruments for
    multiple applications. Long term, the company will provide surgeons with the preeminent
    imaging platform to view, assess, and characterize a range of vessels (i.e. arteries/veins,
    ureters and bile ducts) in real-time for improved surgical guidance and outcomes.
    \n\nThe proposed project will develop a novel blood vessel detection and visualization
    platform using low-cost optical imaging sensors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
    The proposed technology will provide visual and quantitative information about
    vessel presence and size in real-time that can supplement a surgeon's technique.
    This system will be simple, cost-effective, easy to employ, and highly accurate.
    Traditionally, the avoidance of blood vessels during minimally invasive surgery
    is accomplished by visualization or costly intraoperative imaging. The proposed
    technology will use pulsatile light absorption characteristics of blood vessels
    to provide quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time,
    supplementing a surgeon's technique. This project will also add significant value
    to the body of research conducted in the areas of signal processing and image
    analysis. In addition, the proposed technology will remove the risk of data loss
    due to artifacts in general and motion artifacts in particular. The proposed technology
    will be validated ex vivo and in vivo using a porcine animal model."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the objective of demonstrating that discrete, belt mounted internet-connected wearable devices used by industrial workers can detect high risk lifting activities, promote safe lifting practices and behavior change, and predict the risk of musculoskeletal injuries due to unsafe lifting. Each year over 600,000 workers suffer a musculoskeletal injury due to lifting related activities, which cost US companies over $15bn annually. Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries.

    The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events. When a lift is considered high risk, real-time feedback will be provided to the worker; ii) the deployment of the device in an industrial setting at several customer sites for 12 months, with the number of high risk lifts performed by workers quantified over time to measure the ability of the system to drive behavior change in the workforce; and ii) the development of a model that can predict the likelihood of musculoskeletal injures based on the risk metrics measured. It is expected that the outcomes of the project demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of suffering musculoskeletal injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment value proposition for the industrial companies and their insurance carriers who are potential customers.

    continuous sensing applications in a wide range of energy-constrained sensor-enabled
    devices. Without dramatic innovations in the development of ultralow power sensory
    processing, continuous and accurate sensing will remain a niche application limited
    to environments with a stable and plentiful power source and significant computing
    resources. The technology described in this proposal will demonstrate the viability
    and potential widespread deployment of continuous sensing devices in mobile or
    remote environments with strict energy constraints. An important immediate market
    for the proposed technology with significant customer base is the smartphone and
    wearables market, where many new and emerging end user applications could leverage
    environmental sensing to trigger context-based and anticipatory actions. The proposed
    technology is broadly applicable to a number of other markets and domains, including
    medical, health, and safety monitoring of critical patient sensors, personal fitness
    devices, military applications, and environmental monitors. The ability to flexibly
    deploy continuous sensing for these and other applications has the potential to
    revolutionize these markets and create entirely new and unforeseen application
    domains. \n\t\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase 2 Project plans to
    research and develop algorithms based on the properties of biological spiking
    neurons and the sensory processing capabilities of the human brain. The human
    brain is truly unique in its ability to use a basic computational element, the
    spiking neuron, and perform a broad variety of tasks. The brain has the ability
    to accurately classify sensory patterns from multiple modalities (touch, sight,

    key intellectual merit of this project is a demonstration of how these novel neural
    algorithms can perform accurate, robust, and low power sensory analysis across
    multiple sensory domains. Just as the brain is capable of processing data from
    very different sensors. Researching and developing these neural algorithms will
    provide insight as to how the human brain learns to recognize important sensory
    information, how it is able to integrate information from such different sense
    modalities, and how it is able to perform complex analysis so efficiently."

    on developing compact camera modules with lower noise and improved contrast using
    a submicron pixel imaging sensor array. The commercial potential of this project
    centers on developing compact cameras for endoscopes, navigational and robotic
    surgical systems and more. Embedding these cameras in endoscope systems, and even
    the surgical tools themselves, permits new treatments across a broad range of
    medical specialties that otherwise are not possible. Switching to the minimally
    invasive forms of some common surgeries could save an estimated $14 billion in
    healthcare spending. Oncology, urology, gastroenterology, women's health and pediatric
    medicine are just some of the specialties that will significantly benefit from
    these ultra-compact cameras. A broader impact will ultimately come from utilizing
    submicron pixels in unique ways in high density arrays. The sensor?s small size
    and fast response times offer unique opportunities for spatial and temporal oversampling.
    The resulting large numbers of pixels can be employed in a compact multi-aperture
    arrangement to deliver significantly enhanced color mapping over traditional semiconductor
    imaging arrays, multispectral imaging, 3-dimensional image reconstruction, motion
    free auto-focusing, or some combination of the above, providing unique applications
    in medical imaging, defense, robotics, and consumer electronics.  \n\nThe miniaturization
    of camera systems calls for the continuous shrinking of pixel sizes. At a certain
    point, however, the maximum photo-electrons a pixel can hold becomes limited,
    yielding low signal-to-noise ratios and poor dynamic range. This project develops
    a novel optical sensor that maintains sensitivity down to hundreds of nanometers.
    As the size of this sensor decreases, the maximum measurable light intensity can
    remain constant and the signal-to-noise increases, bringing significant improvements
    to images? dynamic range and color/feature rendition. This result stands in stark
    contrast to the behavior of conventional pixels where maximum intensity threshold
    scales down with pixel size and noise increases with decreasing pixel size. Reducing
    these image sensors to practice requires transitioning from gallium arsenide based
    devices to silicon.  The work focuses on 1) finalizing design parameters, fabrication,
    and characterization of the electrical properties and optical response of the
    system and 2) fabrication and characterization of a linear photodetector array
    for the creation of both linear images and 2-D images assembled from linear images

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the effort to bring our biomimetic rotor
    design to the marine hydrokinetic (MHK) market. MHK energy is a socially and environmentally
    friendly alternative to hydroelectric power, which harnesses energy from rivers,
    tides, ocean currents and manmade waterways without the use of a dam. This market
    is potentially large but still nascent due to high technology costs, concerns
    over turbine survivability, fish friendliness, and difficulty in permitting deployments.
    Our rotor's small, flexible configuration is a unique approach that addresses
    many MHK challenges with the mission of reaching the largest set of individuals
    underserved by current energy technologies. Our rotor seeks to displace diesel
    generation and complement intermittent renewable energy sources by providing an
    affordable, baseload clean energy solution for any individual or community; with
    the objective of scaling up to larger deployments by leveraging the scalable rotor
    design. This R&D Project will expand the body of knowledge for the rapidly emerging
    field of biomimicry by developing a flexible micro-hydro solution that enables
    energy generation from flowing water by allowing fluids to move over the surfaces
    of the rotor in their naturally preferred way. \n\n\n\nThis project will transform
    our promising proprietary rotor design into an optimized MHK turbine to be incorporated
    as the key component of a flexible micro-hydro system that addresses many of the
    challenges faced by the MHK market. The rotor is based on biomimicry and was designed
    using streamlines found in moving bodies of water with a deep profile to maximize
    the power transfer from low speed flows. The logarithmic design with receding
    edges results in a turbine that avoids damaging impacts with debris and marine
    life. The design is stable in variable flow conditions, which allows for a flexible
    power takeoff configuration with both the generator and power electronics housed
    above the water for improved affordability. During the project, computational
    fluid dynamic modeling will be used to simulate design changes and drive performance
    improvements. The most promising designs will be prototyped and integrated with
    multiple generator and tether combinations to determine the most efficient flexible
    power takeoff system. Conversion to power output for 12V battery charging will
    also be tested and optimized resulting in a complete power conversion chain. The
    performance of the rotor and system will be characterized by full scale testing
    locally and with The University of Washington."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its ability to improve healthcare in fundamental ways, such as (1) low volume draws that will enable diagnostics in low-resource settings like drug stores, at home, or in developing countries, (2) higher quality small-volume samples to make Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics more competitive with lab tests, enabling faster results in critical care/outpatient environments, and (3) low draw volumes, coupled with small volume diagnostic tests, that will enable improved care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired anemia, including neonates and patients with bone marrow damage caused by cancers or suppressed bone marrow due to cancer drugs. Our technology will enable medical testing from a small amount of blood, which could significantly impact global neonatal and pediatric healthcare, particularly in developing countries, and expand the market for blood containers.


    This project aims to design a microliter-scale blood container that offers the same analytic stability and consistency as blood samples obtained by larger volume tubes.  Critical to specimen stability is the ability to rapidly and uniformly distribute an anticoagulant in a blood specimen.  In larger containers, mixing is achieved by shaking a collection tube, creating turbulent flow wherein eddies and vortices mix the blood with the stabilizing reagent.  In low volume containers, fluid flow is laminar and shaking does not produce mixing.  Typical low volume containers rely on diffusion driven mixing.  This process is slow, and frequently results in the formation of micro-clots prior to complete specimen stabilization.  We will use our proprietary actuated, surface-attached posts (ASAP) to rapidly and thoroughly distribute anticoagulant in blood, increasing the accuracy and the reproducibility of results obtained from small volume draws.  This project will begin with an assessment of the biocompatibility of materials and specimen processing procedures.  We will test a number of ASAP configurations in order to minimize the time required for specimen stabilization.  The project will culminate with the production of a fully functional prototype that will be validated via comparison against blood stabilized in a larger volume specimen tube.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in providing manufactured concrete blocks that can be used to build arches, including roofs.  This feature has never been done with manufactured concrete block, and holds the potential to greatly expand the uses, benefits and capabilities of concrete block to an entirely new market segment.  The structures expected to be made possible with this novel masonry system include inexpensive, high-performance, energy efficient buildings with increased fire safety ratings, resistance to termites, increased safety for tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis and other sever weather events, and greatly increased building life cycle time. This technology could have a large positive economic impact on masonry construction and on the concrete block manufacturing industry in particular, both across the US and around the globe.  This work is expected to provide a greater understanding of the anisotropic strength of manufactured concrete block, and how this anisotropic strength is to be maximized within a given structure; this scientific understanding is expected to benefit the catenary thrust-line analysis of masonry arches.  This technology is expected to make superior construction available to homeowners, businesses, government buildings and public works (including bridges) at greatly reduced cost.


    This project will create a design for a building which will utilize as many of the common features made available by this masonry system which the average user (homeowner, building owner, business, government agency, etc.) is expected to want to use.  This building will be designed as a planetarium for Alfred University's Stull Observatory, and will include a twenty-four foot diameter planetarium room, as a domed hemisphere, made as a third frequency truncated icosahedron.  This building will also include a separate meeting room and a separate office.  This building will include Gothic windows, arched roofs, and flying buttresses which will create an outdoor porch which rings the outside of this building.  This building will be designed with a Professional Engineer and a Registered Design Professional (architect) to show all the equations, stress analyses, free body diagrams, etc., which were used to arrive at the final design.  Once completed, this building will serve as a test or sample building used to obtain an Evaluation Report by the International Code Council - Evaluation Services (ICC-ES).  A positive Evaluation Report from ICC-ES will allow this technology to be sold globally in accordance with the International Building Code (IBC).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality of care for anterior ocular wounds. To accomplish this, the project is focused on the development of a novel, hand-held, point-of-care device that can be used to evaluate the ocular surface in post-trauma or post-surgical patients. The device should be able to provide an accurate, objective measurement of a tear film biomarker that can be used by medical professionals to identify dangerous fluid leaks in the front of the eye which can save vision. Currently, this evaluation is only performed by trained eye doctors and requires positioning the patient at an expensive, immobile machine called a slit lamp to evaluate their eye. This cannot be done on patients who are unconscious or uncooperative and availability of this machine is limited. The lack of adequate tools for evaluation results in limited access to care, costly hospital transfers and missed diagnosis of wound leaks which can cause severe ocular infections and permanent vision loss. Successful commercialization of this product is expected to improve the accuracy of ocular examinations in 3.8 million Americans annually and may introduce a new frontier of tear film testing.


    The proposed project is focused on developing the device for direct use for patient care. The technological aim of the research is on the creation of a sophisticated biosensor that can accurately and noninvasively evaluate the tear film concentration of a specific biomarker. This work is expected to include the development of the electrical circuitry, the chemical composition and the channels for connection to the base unit. The plan is to also design the model for the handheld device. In order to make the device safe for patient use, the device can then be tested for its shelf-life stability and develop the proper sterilization. The next steps of testing can include clinical patients to evaluate the ability of the device to record the findings from the tear film. This information can then be used to refine the exact testing parameters for the device. The anticipated result of this research is a final prototype of the device that can be used for regulatory approval and clinical trials. The goal of the project is to transform the current standard of care for eye professionals and enable physicians to have an objective measure that can warn them about possible wound leaks and potentially save vision.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the improvement of atmospheric state observations from various platforms. This compact, integrated and ?plug and play? receiver design will make the existing observations more available, more economical, and will also enable previously unattainable observations of water vapor distributions within the atmosphere. This environmental sensor?s small size and low power requirements enables its deployment on various airborne, spaceborne or ground-based platforms, such as unmanned aerial aircraft, nanosatellites, ocean buoys, and remotely located ground-based instruments. One promising commercial application is private weather observing satellite constellations. It has been estimated that around 400 remote sensing nano/microsatellites will be launched worldwide between the years of 2016-2018. Water vapor and cloud observations are among the most important observations promising further understanding of weather events and to better synoptic or mesoscale forecasts. Improved atmospheric observations are directly related to increasingly accurate and useful weather forecasts. The benefits are expected to extend widely across the economy. Meteorologists point to more accurate and rapidly refreshed atmospheric observations as one of the necessities for the continuous improvements in weather forecasting, understanding of the atmospheric physics and climate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will complete the design and build a fully functional prototype of a very compact, direct detection radiometer receiver, operating in the vicinity of the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line. All the receiver components will be designed and evaluated, including a noise source, detectors, filters, Monolithic Microwave Integrated circuits and others, first as individual parts and then within the assembly. A novel receiver architecture and integration of all components into one assembly allow for a drastic reduction in the receiver size and reduction of its power consumption, while improving its observational capabilities and stability. There are several aspects of the proposed effort that are unique and would provide profound advances in ultra-compact microwave radiometry. The receiver is expected to consume less than 0.5 Watt of power and weigh around 100 grams, with a continuous two-point calibration capability at its input.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to overcome limitations that prevent effective treatment of wound infections. There is a large potential market for this product as the U.S. spends over $50 billion per year on wound care and current wound care products have a high risk of rejection, scarring, and antibiotic resistance. The proposed novel wound care product will reduce the costs to treat infected wounds and limit the number of medical procedures required to restore tissue function. The product consists of a patented human extracellular matrix (hECM) coupled to a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP). The main innovation of the proposed product, compared to current treatments, is that it is designed to be toxic to infective bacteria and other pathogens, without harming human tissue. The hECM has regenerative and anti-inflammatory activity to enhance wound healing and improve treatment outcomes. In addition to creating a transformative product in a global market, achievement of AMP extracellular matrix tethering will lead to a broader understanding of AMP activity and unlock their commercial utility. The product can be used as a temporary wound dressing, a tissue restoring implant, or an implant coating.


    The proposed project will utilize a patented recombinant protein with an antimicrobial peptide, combined with a human extracellular matrix (hECM) material. The patented antimicrobial protein (AMP) is designed to bind collagen in the hECM. The combination of hECM and AMP will result in an antimicrobial regenerative matrix that will reduce the incidence of infection and improve wound healing. The objectives of the project are to scale-up hECM and AMP manufacturing processes, establish methods for assessing product characteristics and performance for manufacturing quality assurance and release criteria, and evaluate the shelf-life and in vivo performance of the scaled-up manufactured AMP-hECM product in a clinically relevant infectious wound healing model.  The AMP-hECM will be evaluated using biochemical, antimicrobial, mechanical and cell growth performance assays.  Scale-up of the bioengineered AMP and hECM will be achieved by optimizing the in vitro manufacturing bioreactor growth parameters and processing methods to improve overall product yield.  The anticipated outcome of the project is to have defined the large-scale manufacturing protocols and release criteria for the AMP-hECM product. This milestone will enable the execution of validation production runs, and advance the regulatory and commercialization pathways for the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a pressing need for more environmentally responsible coating alternatives in the anti-corrosion market through the commercialization of a novel aluminum-based coating.   If successfully commercialized, the aluminum electroplating process will displace multiple existing anti-corrosion coatings, which are based on toxic metals.  The current market for these coatings is valued at $10 billion annually.  The replacement of the toxic metals with aluminum will eliminate their release into the environment.  The process is also expected to be less expensive than the incumbent technologies.  The reduction in cost arises from decreases in plating solution, waste treatment, and metal costs.  By decreasing the cost of corrosion-resistant coatings, it may also be possible to reduce the flow of plating jobs to less environmentally responsible areas overseas.  For the aerospace industry, which is the initial target market, the availability of the process will mean safer conditions for workers, less environmental impact, and lower costs. In the process of addressing these needs in the coatings market, the research will elucidate a variety of interesting phenomena associated with electroplating of highly active metal species.

    The intellectual merit of this project is associated with its exploration of aqueous electroplating of highly active metals in the presence of atmospheric moisture and oxygen.  Typically, electroplating of aluminum has taken place from organic solvents such as toluene at elevated temperatures under an inert purge.  The expense and difficulty in scaling this technology has prevented its adoption for many applications, which might make good use of aluminum coatings.  The goal of the project will be to overcome the technical challenges in scaling-up an aqueous aluminum electroplating process for producing aluminum coatings.  Challenges to be addressed include mass transfer, current distribution, and coating quality control in industrial-scale plating baths.  To address these challenges, the project team will work closely with partners in the electroplating industry, ultimately demonstrating the technology at scale in a working commercial plating shop.

    The game aligns with Common Core Standards and the Universal Design for Learning
    framework. While this project will be designed for students with disabilities,
    it is assumed the highly accessible career preparation software will also meet
    a critical need for other students at risk of learning failure or students without
    disabilities. \n\nThis project is a critical component of a comprehensive product

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a hormone-free treatment alternative for women suffering from vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy is a condition in which the vaginal tissue is thin, dry, and inelastic. Women with vaginal atrophy experience day-to-day vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. This SBIR project catalyzes the development of a technology platform that will enable a novel home-use, hormone-free medical device to treat vaginal atrophy. This project represents a medical device treatment for vaginal atrophy developed specifically for women wishing to avoid hormone-based therapies. Currently available treatment options fall in two categories: over-the-counter products and hormone-replacement therapies. Over-the-counter products, like lubricants, are available at drugstores, but these products are often limited in their efficacy relative to the severity of symptoms many women experience. Hormone-replacement therapies on the other hand, such as estrogen creams, can be effective for women; however they are contraindicated for large market segments of women (e.g. breast cancer survivors and women with cardiovascular risk factors). Therefore, this SBIR project is critical to the development of a safe treatment alternative for women and represents a chance to significantly improve their quality of life.

    The proposed project supports the technical work required to develop this medical device treatment and addresses a major unmet need for breast cancer survivors and post-menopausal women. The work supported by this SBIR grant will complete necessary device improvements and prepare the technology platform for commercialization. The main objectives of this project are to 1) optimize the device for safety and usability, 2) execute specific design enhancements to ensure cost-effective manufacturability, and 3) complete all necessary quality system testing to meet FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requirements. To achieve the first objective, the company will complete all prescribed activities under the company's quality management system. User interviews will also be completed with device prototypes to explore features that enable and encourage appropriate device use. This work will be completed in cooperation between the company's engineering team and an outside industrial design firm. The second objective will require design for manufacturing activities, which will also be completed in a partnership with an outside firm. The third objective will be executed again by following the company's quality management system policies, processes, and procedures. All of these activities, once complete, will ensure the company's device is ready for commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the result of introducing a new generation of low-power wireless sensors for detecting Acoustic Emission events and detecting fatigue damage in structures. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US transportation infrastructure has 605,102 operational bridges, of which 66,561 are structurally deficient. In particular, the fatigue damage monitoring technology of the project will initially target the more than 18,000 US highway bridges that are categorized as ?fracture critical? by the Federal Highway Administration. The technique?s ultra-low energy consumption will enable its use in low-power wireless sensors and make it an ideal response to this challenging problem. The anticipated benefits and commercial applications of this project are (1) a low-cost, easy-to-use mechanism for effective monitoring, allowing for early detection and timely repair of fracture and fatigue damage in infrastructure systems such as highway bridges; (2) improved public safety, with reduced maintenance costs and extension of the service life of critical and high-valued infrastructure systems; and (3) additional commercial applications in monitoring the structural health and integrity of other structures, including aircraft, oil and gas pipelines, machinery, cargo cranes, ships, etc.

    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure systems, particularly highway bridges. Because the creation of fatigue cracks in a structure is accompanied by the propagation of acoustic emission (AE) waves, wireless AE sensors can be used to detect such cracks. However, a challenge of AE detection sensors is high energy consumption, significantly more than the energy available in a battery-operated wireless device. As a result, conventional AE detection methods cannot be used with low-power wireless sensors. This project uses a novel and ultra-low power technique for long term monitoring of strain.  Then, AE monitoring is activated only if history of tensile strain in the structure under monitoring suggests likelihood of fatigue damage. In addition, using history and pattern of AE events, the method estimates the severity of fatigue damage in a material. Moreover, the method uses a variety of techniques to eliminate the effects of mechanical noise on AE measurements and achieve a high reliability in fatigue damage assessment. After development, the method is planned to be evaluated on highway bridges, airframes, and pipelines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to a wide range of electronics in the areas of communications, Internet, portable electronics, and power electronics. Although magnetic based transformers have been the industry standard for over a century they have many negatives including miniaturization difficulties, electromagnetic interference issues, and issues with larger voltage step-up applications. The main goal of the research is to develop a ceramic replacement for magnetic transformers that is both conducive to miniaturization, provides higher power densities, provides a large increase in safe operating temperatures, and that is cost competitive with standard magnetic devices. This technology will provide important advantages for many applications; the ability to produce at low cost also opens up large new markets that are not easily reached using conventional magnetics.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to develop new low temperature sintering processes and transformer structures that enable the use of base metal electrodes to replace very expensive platinum. This drastically reduces costs of ceramic transformers and substantially improves performance due to the fact that a poor electrical/thermal conductor, Platinum, is now replaced with base metal (Copper) that is a high performance electrical/thermal conductor. This translates into both higher power throughput in devices that are lighter weight and lower profile and also a new ability to now match the high temperature range of wide bandgap power devices. The success of this program immediately leads to a revolutionary next step of being able to insert power management/conversion electronics directly within integrated circuits such as in application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research, Phase II project is to help make therapy more consistent with patient preferences, beliefs, and values to maximize engagement in therapy and improve patient outcomes. Therapy for mental health problems is highly effective, yet many patients drop out before getting the full benefit because they are not satisfied or engaged in the therapy. The proposed project involves collecting data on all of patients actions in the online treatment system along with their ratings of each activity and their symptom improvement over time. The research and development team will use this data to create a machine learning system that will make suggestions for best next steps in therapy based on what thousands of other users experienced. This is the intelligent counseling system. It will work very similarly to movie streaming services or online book sellers who recommend movies or books to you based on your past preferences and the preferences of thousands of other users.

    The proposed project will develop a feedback and recommendation system based on advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to provide personalized treatments to customize and individualize online mental health treatment, the Intelligent Counseling System (ICS). This personalized system will contain a number of alternative treatment items from several theoretical perspectives, using a variety of patient interactive activities, varying in format, length, pace, and other characteristics. In such a setting, a recommendation system can predict the users' preferences and recommend the subsequent treatment component. In addition, to achieve maximum adherence and to decrease the attrition rate, the platform will enable personalized motivational interventions and supportive messaging. The delivery times and the content of supportive messaging will adapt and vary depending on the projected treatment progress. Our machine learning based system will be trained incrementally as more data becomes available over time, thus it will benefit from improved accuracy over time. We will extract local, semi-local, and global temporal features at multiple temporal resolutions and will use feature selection techniques to identify which factors contribute to the success of treatments for patients, and to predict if a user is improving or is deteriorating. This will result in adaptive motivational messages and recommendation for tailoring treatment in term of important identified treatment features.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a portable, low cost blood typing and anemia screening device for use in blood donation centers, hospitals, humanitarian efforts and the military.   This helps society because every two seconds in United States someone needs blood, yet less than 4% of Americans donate blood.  Unfortunately, 15-20% of blood collected is wasted due to over collection of unneeded blood types and related blood type logistics.  12 million units of blood are collected annually in US with 108 million units worldwide.   U.S. blood centers are under significant economic pressures to reduce per unit blood costs and thus waste reduction tools and strategies are in demand.  Blood unit costs approach $200 per pint of blood, so this device provides the ability to pre-screen donors by blood type and selectively direct the donation process (i.e. plasma, red cells) to reduce blood product waste and better match supply with hospital demand.   This portable technology could also be translated to remote geographical locations for disaster relief applications. The potential economic savings has the potential to be $400M and will contribute to reducing the overall cost of U.S. health care.

    The proposed project will advance knowledge across multiple fields.  It adapts knowledge in microfluidics and the use of electric fields to characterize cells to identify the molecular expression on blood cells responsible for ABO-Rh blood type.  This project advances the use of electric fields to rapidly measure cell concentration.  This project develops software for real time tracking of cell population motion, which is highly valuable in many cell microscopy applications.  This project also adapts advanced pattern recognition tools like machine learning to extract even more information from the cell behaviors. This work also extends statistical analysis from static population means to analysis of functional data - a field in its infancy - via a critical application.   Finally, the device and electronics engineering will advance under the principle that "simple is best", leading to fewer potential failure points and less costly manufacture. This work advances scientific knowledge and will be published and widely disseminated after securing additional IP. It is also a powerful alternative to expensive antigen/antibody molecular recognition reactions (i.e. traditional blood typing) for medical screening and diagnosis for future point of care diagnostic applications.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project intends
    to meet the need for low cost dose-on-demand production of Carbon-11 isotope for
    biomarker and radiotracer applications in nuclear medicine.  Biomarkers and radiotracers
    are commonly used for Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT)
    metabolic imaging, in support of research, drug discovery, and detection of cancer
    and other illnesses.  They are also used for therapy staging of cancer, to determine
    if treatment is effective.  Common examples include myocardial perfusion imaging
    of the heart to visualize blood flow and function, PET scanning of the brain to
    detect early onset Alzheimer's and brain tumors, and Choline PET/CT for the diagnosis
    and staging of prostate cancer. Carbon-11 is an important radiotracer/radiopharmaceutical
    that offers unique advantages due to its ability to be easily incorporated into
    many molecules without impacting biological activity.  Carbon-11 is currently
    produced by using specialized targets on high-energy commercial cyclotrons.  These
    cyclotrons cost millions of dollars to install, and existing targets are inefficient.
    \ Low energy cyclotrons are significantly less expensive, and are currently under
    development by multiple commercial companies.  This project seeks to develop a
    novel cyclotron target methodology for producing Carbon-11 at low energies using
    unique nanomaterials, resulting in significantly lower costs.  \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is in the use of novel nanomaterials to produce Carbon-11
    more efficiently and at lower cost, through development of recoil escape targets.
    \ It is challenging to find a good target material suitable for both efficient
    production of Carbon-11, by one of several available nuclear reactions, and efficient
    recovery of the produced radiotracer in a usable form.  The produced Carbon-11
    can be difficult to recover, as it is easily trapped in many conventional target
    materials, resulting in low yields.  Recent advances in nanoscience and technology
    allow for production of novel materials with unique characteristics.  Boron nitride
    nanotubes (BNNT) are composed of fibers with single atomic thickness, or at most
    a few atoms thick, allowing Carbon-11 to be efficiently produced and recovered
    in the form of carbon dioxide gas using low energy cyclotrons.  Prototype production
    targets will be developed and tested at commercial cyclotron sites.  The process
    for collecting the produced Carbon-11 gas will be optimized to achieve the highest
    yields of usable radiotracer material.  Efforts will be made to further develop
    BNNT materials with ideal characteristics, including high purity and optimal density."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is very significant. Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments and hospitals leads to inefficiencies that result in excessive patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected by hospitals, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist administrators in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve hospital efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 hospitals in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department or hospital whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs.

    The proposed project promises to yield a set of decision-support applications upon which emergency departments and hospitals will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will develop software applications, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments and hospitals. This project will involve 1) addressing the real-time needs of hospital operational decision-makers, 2) further developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform to inform these real-time needs, specifically reflecting emergency departments and whole hospitals, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery throughout the hospital.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes the reduction in severe patient morbidity and elimination of hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditures by the U.S. healthcare system each year on revision surgeries and unnecessary procedures associated with late detection of post-surgical blood clots. Surgeons have the ability to prevent these catastrophic events, but only if the onset of the clot can be detected in a timely manner. Currently, of the patients who form clots after the targeted surgeries, half will suffer from a surgical failure due to the shortcomings of current modalities. This technology gives clinicians the ability to non-invasively track changes in blood flow within critical vessels to enable intervention prior to any compromise in health and prevent a majority of these catastrophic incidents. Beyond significant decreases in patient suffering and morbidity, such interventions will have an enormous positive economic impact on the health care system. This technology can also substantially improve clinical understanding of the clotting process and possibly enable non-invasive therapeutic treatments for these patients who otherwise would receive surgery.

    The proposed project offers significant intellectual and scientific merit associated with new methods of ultrasound flow analysis. The objective of this work is to develop a system that is able to collect a 3D volume of ultrasound data and automatically extract the blood flow data in the region of interest by detecting an implantable component. This novel approach to measuring vascular flow will be the first to enable detection of localized post-operative clot formation rather than detecting clot-related issues via delayed and indirect methods that leave patients at risk for surgical failures. This technique can allow for intervention earlier than all other available methods, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing hospital costs. Furthermore, this method enables automatic detection of critical changes in blood flow, eliminating the risk of human error. Lastly, dissemination of the technology developed in this proposal represents an important milestone towards the creation of simpler, more automated ultrasound systems that can place this non-invasive, non-ionizing modality in the hands of non-expert clinicians for use in a broader spectrum of medical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries.

    The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create a suite of consumer hardware and software products that provide realistic tactile feedback to users who are touching objects in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). As evidenced by the current proliferation of low-cost head-mounted displays and motion tracking systems, three-dimensional interaction technologies are revolutionizing how people interact with computers, media, and each other. Since they are currently limited to vision and audio, endowing consumer-level human-computer interfaces with high-fidelity tactile feedback will vastly increase user immersion, making games more fun, online interactions more effective, and tools more efficient. Consequently, this project has the potential to expand the commercial reach of the burgeoning VR/AR market, opening up myriad opportunities for companies particularly in the gaming, entertainment, and e-commerce sectors. The innovation of this project also promises to enhance scientific and technological understanding of haptic human-computer interaction by establishing a new paradigm that blends minimal wearable hardware with sophisticated software algorithms. Finally, commercializing novel interactive technology also has the potential to help inspire a diverse array of young people to pursue a career in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and math.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to advance knowledge of low-cost technology that can provide realistic tactile feedback to a user touching objects in VR or AR: the project?s intellectual merits center on testing a new approach that combines minimal haptic hardware and sophisticated software algorithms. The research objective is to create a fully functional industrial prototype of a wearable fingertip thimble and custom software that embody the proposed approach. When the user's finger moves to touch a virtual object, a platform inside the thimble will initiate contact with the fingerpad and press with a force that varies with penetration distance, to render surface softness. A thermal actuator will convey the object?s thermal conductivity and temperature. When the finger slides along a virtual object, the user will feel its texture via carefully designed platform vibrations. Specific research tasks to be addressed include exploring haptic actuator options, building a library of haptic object properties (HOPs) that can be applied to virtual objects, and creating a communication protocol for exchanging haptic signals among devices. This project is expected to yield a fully functional industrial prototype and developer kits for the wearable fingertip thimble.

    in design courses and contributes to the training of a strong workforce in areas
    related to science, technology and engineering. The Ecosystem is a software tool
    that automatically verifies designs against the requirements, to uncover oversights
    early in the process, but also fosters engineering judgement and creativity, allows
    for assessment of designs with less subjectivity, and facilitates smooth communication
    among team members. This results in productivity enhancements, higher quality
    designs and shorter time-to-market, but also in societal benefits (safer products,
    less risk of catastrophic accidents and more competitive design organizations).
    The target market consists of (1) educational institutions teaching engineering
    design, and (2) design companies striving to ensure compliance with the design
    specifications.  The core innovation is three-fold.  First, it consists of an
    e-design assessment engine that is being developed to a high degree of sophistication.
    \ Second, design repositories are investigated and developed for integration.
    \ Third, holistic (big data) analysis of design content and metadata is implemented.
    \n\nThe project seeks to develop an innovative design decision (learning) support
    system addressing problems related to the high cost of design oversights. Such
    oversights can result in catastrophic failures, product recalls, or simply in
    budget or schedule over-runs (due to rework).  The Ecosystem offers a flexible,
    yet systematic and generic, framework, for guiding designers through the design
    process, and for automatically assessing design activities, from each stage in
    the design process, against the product design specification (PDS). At the center
    of the Ecosystem is the e-design assessment engine, which decomposes the PDS,
    correlates the design activities against individual requirements, and provides
    real-time advisories in case of design oversights. The assessment engine automatically
    configures popular development tools for engineering design, determines relevant
    analyses, and interprets the outputs. The Ecosystem interfaces with these development
    tools, but does not replace. The Ecosystem can translate qualitative customer
    requirements into solid engineering requirements, and verify the relevance of
    the design content provided through seamless interfaces with industry databases.
    The Ecosystem improves designers' productivity through automation of many administrative
    tasks (e.g., generation of project reports). Despite the automation, the learning
    experience is not diminished. The Ecosystem prompts for, captures, and preserves
    the rationale for relevant engineering decisions. It also supports accredited,
    generic learning objectives for engineering design."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide wireless technology for economic high-speed internet connectivity in under-served rural regions, addressing the needs of 40 million Americans and over 50% of the global population. The technological developments in this project will pave the way for adoption of Massive, or Many-Antenna MIMO technologies in next-generation wireless systems by addressing scalability bottlenecks with innovative hardware and protocol design. The result of this project will be a revolutionary new wireless system for internet service providers addressing an $80 billion fixed wireless systems market and connecting under-served global communities to high-speed internet commerce, communications, education, and entertainment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop a production-ready Television White Space (TVWS) Massive MU-MIMO wireless system for IP data traffic, then use it to characterize for the first time diverse, large-scale multi-user TVWS channels. This project will demonstrate the first economically-viable Massive MIMO system, as well as the first point-to-multipoint wireless system capable of non-line-of-sight ranges over 10s of miles with over 2 Gbps of aggregate capacity. The system will be used to measure and characterize TVWS channels at scale in various rural environments, with large beamforming arrays serving tens of clients tens of miles away. In particular, these measurements will explore the effect of range, environment, user separation, and polarization on real-world achievable capacity. The results will be used to guide the design, optimization, and deployment of rural TVWS broadband networks across the world.

    This SBIR Phase II project offers a unique approach to teaching the difficult content of operating with fractions through interactive, adaptive games. Existing products are not effective at teaching fractions, and half of US eighth graders cannot correctly order three fractions, a fourth grade standard. Current research and the Common Core State Standards emphasize using a number line to teach fractions, which is a more effective approach; however, leading curricula are not fully aligned to this method. This project aims to improve 3rd-5th grade students' understanding of fractions through engaging apps that encourage estimation and problem-solving. Unlike other apps, which typically end with just a score, this project will provide rich, actionable insight to help teachers screen and monitor students' progress over time, thereby improving teachers' instruction as well as student learning. Closely aligning with NSF's mission of improving mathematics education for all children, this project fills an essential need in the marketplace for engaging, effective software that aligns with Common Core and provides data-driven intervention support. This software will be specially designed for children who struggle in mathematics and will meet the criteria for intervention software, further increasing its commercial value for the school market and its potential to generate income.

    This project aims to improve children's use of efficient strategies in estimating and solving fractions arithmetic by targeting children?s metastrategic awareness and metacognitive abilities. This project will include the development of a series of fractions apps and game-based data reporting for teachers to help them tailor instruction and target interventions. Extracting actionable insight from children?s gameplay rather than from standardized tests is a novel innovation that has the potential to dramatically change teaching and learning. The development process will include wireframing novel gameplay and developing app components and features. The backend system will identify learning patterns within clickstream data collected during play and apply data-mining techniques to these patterns. Instead of assessing single actions as correct or incorrect, the backend will identify series of actions and associate them with a particular strategy. This data will be used to inform instructors, test hypotheses, and provide evidence for learning. A dynamic content generation engine will use the insights extracted from student data to provide learners with highly targeted, fine-tuned activities. The project?s research will include both informal design research and a randomized control study with 3rd-5th grade students to determine the effects of using the software on procedural and conceptual knowledge of fractions.

    This Phase II project is to the first personalized learning platform for hands-on education that works with the billions of mobile devices already in people's hands worldwide. Because the technology works on any mobile device and requires little instructor facilitation, it will be commercially successful in home settings when parents are busy and school settings where budget restrictions limit the number of facilitators. Beyond commercial impact, this project will help address the nation's need to prepare citizens for the 21st century economy, improve science literacy and help provide equal opportunities to underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This project is an effective teaching tool because it employs personalized learning, where the content and pace of learning are optimized for the individual learner. Personalized learning has already been shown to result in higher learner engagement and increased retention of concepts in educational software. Through the use of proprietary augmented reality and adaptive learning technology, this project brings personalized learning to hands-on STEM education, enabling learners to develop problem solving skills in a more effective, engaging and lower cost way.

    The key innovation in this project is a single software framework combining advanced augmented reality  (AR) and adaptive learning (AL) techniques to capture learners? interactions with real world objects (for example, circuit blocks, fraction bricks or chemistry models) via a mobile device camera, analyze the significance of the interactions and automatically provide personalized guidance to each learner.  The system will be the first to provide a high level API above the complexity of AR and AL, allowing designers of learning experience modules to focus solely on content and user experience instead of hundreds of thousands of lines of complex code associated with AR and AL. The methods employed will be the research, design and development of the augmented reality and adaptive learning engine, its integration with three learning experience modules: circuits, fractions, basic geometry, and an evaluation of the modules. To guide the development, pilot studies utilizing A/B testing with competing approaches, pre and post assessments, and behavioral analysis of users interacting with the system will be conducted periodically.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will revolutionize the treatment of individuals with autism. One of every sixty-eight US children has autism (over 1.1 million). The estimated cost of providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to those who could benefit is $7.5 billion dollars annually. Societal impacts include: 1) more individuals with autism across the globe will receive treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced. Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy.

    The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology.  Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism. The project will build on a large body of recent work in visualization, machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its ability to implement multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) detectors of any size. This, in turn, impacts the broad needs of wireless
    communications industry that is always in search of more efficient use of the scarce spectral resources.
    Since its invention 15 years ago, MIMO has been included in all wireless standards, e.g. WiFi,
    WiMAX, and LTE. As of today, MIMO products of sizes up to 4x4 (i.e. 4 transmit and 4 receive
    antennas) have appeared in the market, while the most recent standards, such as IEEE 802.11ac WiFi
    and LTE-Advanced cellular, have specified MIMO sizes as large as 8x8. For WiFi this can mean more
    effective hot-spots in public and workplace settings. For cellular this can mean improved connectivity
    in rural areas with fewer base-station towers, having a positive economic impact. Industry activities
    that attempt to build larger MIMO systems such as 16x16 are occurring. Massive MIMO networks with
    more than 100 antennas at the base stations have recently been proposed for 5G cellular and beyond.
    These trends indicate a large market opportunity for the scalable MIMO technology that this project
    builds upon.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project plans to develop and
    commercialize a set of intellectual property (IP) software-codes/IP-cores related to multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) communications. These cores address the needs of wireless chipset
    manufacturers. The main hurdle in the design and implementation of MIMO systems is their
    complexity which drives cost and power consumption. The complexity of an optimal MIMO detector
    grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. The same is true for most of the near
    optimal MIMO detectors that have been suggested in the literature and adopted by industry. This
    limitation has been the main impediment in developing commercial MIMO systems that support larger
    array sizes with increased range and data rate. This project adopts a novel technology that achieves near
    optimal performance having complexity that only grows linearly with the number of transmit antennas.
    It thus can be used to implement MIMO systems of any size, at an affordable complexity.

    the great differentiator in the coming world, and the organizations that thrive
    there will do so because they have the right potentials.  Using the semantics-based
    psychometric approach, this project designs exercises and models that assess one's
    creativity. This project will help employers in acquiring creative employees and
    also train and educate current employees in ways by which they can become more
    creative.  The market is vast, encompassing potentially all employers who hire
    and manage workers with symbol-analytic skills.  According to the 2010 U.S Census,
    there are over 143M people employed in the workforce. This project will expand
    to various sectors of the workforce using strategic partnerships with distribution
    channels in workforce education companies, and talent/human capital management
    companies.   \n\n\nCurrently, creative thinking strategies and assessments are
    taught by experts and consultants in the form of workshops.  Such semantic creativity
    assessment is a manual, time-consuming and expensive process.  This project creates
    a set of open-ended exercises and evaluates each exercise based on the four creative-thinking
    dimensions: 1) Originality:  Original thinking capacity and ability to generate
    novel and out-of-the-box solutions; 2) Fluency: Ideation capacity and ability
    to push past the first set of known responses; 3)Flexibility: Divergent-thinking
    capacity and ability to think non-linearly; and 4)\tElaboration: Detailed-oriented
    and ability to provide intrinsic details about each possible solution and response.
    This project automates such testing by using advances in semantic-based psychometric
    modelling, natural language processing (NLP), semantic networks from computational
    linguistics and computational power for statistical mining of large corpora.  Due
    to ease of scalability, this solution is not limited to any one country or region.
    The solution can be deployed world-wide. Currently, this project has gathered
    data from 161 different countries around the world.  This project is the first
    step towards automation of open-ended exercises in various fields and contexts
    such as situational judgement assessments, emotional intelligence and motivational
    assessments."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is improvement in cost-efficiency, energy-efficiency, and quality in manufacturing automation, increasing worker productivity and reducing repetitive motion injuries. This integrated visual-tactile system will be 3-4 times more inexpensive ($20,000 purchase cost vs. existing $65,000-80,000 vision system), improve the speed and accuracy of current robotic handling systems, and facilitate the automation of repetitive, injury-prone manual tasks. By enabling new robotic applications and increasing productivity in current automation, this solution will help the U.S. maintain a competitive domestic manufacturing sector.  In 2009 there were 36,190 logged repetitive motion injuries in the U.S.; the median missed work time from these injuries was 21 days (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).  This innovative solution will facilitate the automation of repetitive, injury-prone manual tasks and greatly improve the speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of current robotic handling systems.  The immediate commercial applications are in industrial robotics, specifically robotics in agile manufacturing. In the long term, the technology will be applied in personal, healthcare, and military robots. The current market potential for tactile sensors for industrial robots is estimated as $576 million - $1.15 billion and expected to more than double by 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will result in a combined visual-tactile system that will give robots an integrated sense of touch and vision, much like the hand-eye coordination of humans. It incorporates a technically novel compliant tactile sensing solution?a rubber ?skin? that can be molded into any form factor and is inexpensive and durable.  This advanced skin technology can resolve object shape, contact/slip events, and forces of contacted objects.  It will uniquely fuse visual and tactile information for object handling and pose estimation resulting in flexible robotic system that handles objects more like humans do.  This approach addresses key weaknesses in vision-based robotic manufacturing, such as occlusion and dislodging when parts are grasped.  Current industrial robots are restricted in their ability to handle small, irregularly shaped, soft, or fragile parts. Existing solutions rely on expensive and complex 3D-vision systems or repetitive manual labor. This solution is two-fold: (1) A new flexible tactile sensor that can be tailored to a wide variety of form factors; (2) Software to fuse the tactile data with a vision system to estimate pose of objects in pick-and-place tasks.

    the advancement of telerobotic control technology for subsea operations. As humans
    deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific
    sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote
    locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs
    have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical
    machines for construction, maintenance and intervention. Despite advances in sensing
    and machinery, significant challenges persist which have plagued the industry
    with high costs and unacceptable downtime, as well as safety risks. Limited situational
    awareness, data deluge and inadequate manual operator controls combine to create
    high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion
    and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional
    visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated
    robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this
    technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced
    for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs,
    new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the
    national technological infrastructure in subsea operations. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges
    of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls.
    Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command
    and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and
    the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations
    that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and
    that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in
    the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and
    processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and
    vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control
    methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example
    of these technologies. With these technologies combined into a single software
    platform and integrated with a robotic system, increased performance, predictability,
    and safety can be achieved in a way that surpasses what is currently possible
    for purely automated or manual robotic systems. Although this work is focused
    on underwater operations, it can also be extended to terrestrial applications,
    such as industrial assembly, welding and machining, nuclear maintenance and robotic
    dredging and excavation."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to enable affordable detection and enrichment of rare DNA or RNA molecules from a large background population. Currently, such detection is performed on expensive, dedicated instruments that have low sensitivity and are not able to enrich. The strategy is to encapsulate the fluorescently-identified target molecules in thin oil shells so that they mimic cells, and then process them on sensitive and high-throughput cell-sorting instruments that are commonly available. By offloading the detection and enrichment to such machines, all that is required by researchers is a simple tool that encapsulates the molecules in thin oil shells. Applications made possible by high sensitivity and enrichment are numerous, from rare pathogen or cell detection to target capture of uncommon mutant sequences with the goal of downstream sequencing. Between the reduced cost and expansion of capabilities, this approach is likely to become a widely adopted method.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a deployable instrument that allows high-throughput, low-cost quantitation of DNA/RNA molecules in a sample by interfacing with existing flow cytometry instruments. The initial objective is to quickly engineer all the functionality desired in that final instrument into a rough alpha version. Its features will include reliable droplet generation from iteratively optimized hard-plastic microfluidic chips, and automation via an advanced fluid handling system with precise feedback control. The second objective is to build the actual beta version for customer trials. The beta version will replace most of the off-the-shelf parts with streamlined, custom engineering and focus on reducing size and cost while still improving function through more iterative chip optimization. The final objective is to use the beta instrument to optimize the protocols and reagents for several applications using customer samples and benchmarking. At the conclusion of the project, the goal is to have instruments at customer sites generating data.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in bringing epoxy based conductive polymer
    anticorrosion paint system to the market. Corrosion will cost the US economy over
    $1 trillion in 2015. It is highly desirable to develop more effective anticorrosion
    technologies to reduce this huge economic cost of corrosion. The most effective
    anticorrosion pigments in use today are based on heavy metal pigments, such as
    chromates, lead compounds, and zinc/zinc compounds. Environmental, health, and
    safety concerns are driving the elimination of heavy metal pigments. The proposed
    new product will not only reduce toxicity introduced by current heavy-metal based
    anti-corrosion pigments, but also provide much improved corrosion protection.
    The project is especially targeting replacement of the epoxy based zinc-rich primer
    coating systems that are widely used on highway, marine, and energy infrastructures.
    Solving the poor processibility of environmentally friendly conductive polymers
    should enable open up a range of new applications beyond anti-corrosion coatings
    such as electrostatic dissipation, electromagnetic interference shielding, static
    resistant fibers, conductive inks, toners, and adhesives, etc. \n\n\nThe intellectual
    merit of the proposed project lies in using advanced knowledge and understanding
    of anticorrosion coatings. It is generally assumed that organic coatings act as
    barriers to water and oxygen at the coating - environment interface. But corrosion
    of metals is an electrochemical reaction process that relates to both cations
    and anions. The present proposal suggests developing an ion barrier anticorrosion
    coating system: conductive polymer nanoparticle pigmented epoxy primer with a
    topcoat. The combination of the primer and topcoat constructs a barrier to both
    anions and cations, that inhibits the electrochemical corrosion reaction, therefore,
    provides efficient corrosion protection to the metal. This system will not use
    heavy metal anticorrosion pigments any more. If present proposed research succeeds,
    it will demonstrate how an ion barrier coating provides corrosion protection to
    a metal substrate, and how to formulate an ion barrier anticorrosion coating,
    and lead to the next generation of anticorrosion coating."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new tool revealing important information regarding skeletal muscle strength and health. Muscle weakness is a pervasive problem across our society, including people with joint disease, aging people, obese people, and people with neuromuscular disorders. All of these problems affect muscles across the body in different and non-intuitive ways; however, to date there has not been marketed technology that allows for quantitative measurement of muscle size on a muscle-by-muscle basis and specific analysis to address the muscle weakness problem. Due to the current high cost, the initial targeted customers will be elite athlete organizations, with the goal of using the technology to improve performance as well as to provide more quantitative metrics for predicting injury susceptibility and make return-to-sport decisions. However, with research and development to bring down the cost, the ultimate goal is to make a broadly used clinical tool for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions related to musculoskeletal disease and mobility, which will have broad societal impact.

    The proposed project will provide a major advancement in image-based modeling and data analysis tools in order to allow high-throughput imaging, rapid and accurate segmentation of muscles and efficient data analysis. Currently, physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches only have very blunt tools to assess each individual?s strength and very limited information about the optimal muscle profile. Therefore, training and rehabilitative approaches are developed via experience and trial and error. The technology proposed here solves these problems by making using of an image-to-model pipeline to quantify muscle size and provide valuable and actionable information based on the quantification. However, the obstacles for a wide adoption of this technology include specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and lengthy image segmentation process. In the previous funding cycle these two problems have been addressed with substantial technology advancements. The proposed activities in this funding cycle will continue the technical development process to further bring down the cost with improved image segmentation process and provide additional value with advanced data analysis. It will ultimately be a revolutionary tool to improve muscle health.

    effect, improved safety profile, and reduced cost. In addition, it may strongly
    support the long-term activities of drug discovery and development through activating
    potentially efficacious, but hard-to-handle chemical entities. By supporting new
    drugs development and reducing manufacturing cost, this technology will benefit
    the public health and meanwhile create commercial values to the industry. In the
    food and supplement industries, this technology may enable the industry to replace
    non-healthy or even hazardous additives, such as artificial colors and preservatives,
    with natural and healthy alternatives, thus greatly contribute to long-term food
    safety and security as well as public health. To achieve commercialization success,
    a solid portfolio of intellectual properties has been established. Seasoned business
    leaders will work with renowned scientists to incorporate cutting-edge technologies
    into drug, food & nutrition, and personal care products.  \n\nThe proposed project
    will substantially support the development of this new technology. The core problem/opportunity
    this technology targets is a large number of high-value whereas poorly water-soluble
    active ingredients that have been challenging the drug and food industry for a
    long time. For example, around 80% of drug candidates identified by modern drug
    discovery technologies are poorly water-soluble. For food, a large number of vitamins,
    nutrients, antioxidants, and natural colors are poorly water-soluble. Overall,
    poorly water-soluble compounds constitute an enormous formulation challenge. To
    address this need, this team has created a platform technology that is highly
    effective and non-specific. The goal of this project is to further develop the
    technology, scale up the synthesis of a core material, obtain the data on its
    safety profile, and advance the commercialization activities by providing prototypes
    to potential customers. This project will be conducted through close collaborations
    among the start-up company, a major university, and a number of major pharmaceutical,
    ingredients, food, and personal care companies. The deliverables of this project
    include the specifications of core material, initial safety evaluations, and prototypes
    provided to customers. This project will support the start-up company to form
    a solid foundation for commercialization and long-term growth."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve the quality and decrease the high costs associated with treating patients who suffer severe traumatic brain injuries. This project aims to develop an accurate, affordable (<$100 per use) and non-invasive device to monitor a patient's intracranial pressure following head injury. Increased intracranial pressure can result in poor health outcomes including long-term disability or death, if left untreated. However, the only available method to monitor intracranial pressure is expensive (~$10,000 per patient) and requires neurosurgery. The lack of a method to accurately screen patients to determine who needs surgery results in misdiagnoses and incorrect treatment in about 46% of patients among an estimated 50,000 patients in the US alone, and hundreds of thousands more globally. Successful commercialization of product is expected to result in savings in the range $250 million ever year to the US healthcare system.

    The proposed project will develop a medical device to accurately display a patient's intracranial pressure non-invasively and for use outside of the neurocritical care unit. The core technological approach of the proposed work is the analysis of blood flow velocity waveforms using advanced signal processing methods in a machine-learning framework. The machine-learning framework allows experience-based learning utilizing prior, established databases of waveforms that have been well-characterized. Three new machine-learning paradigms that utilize the shape features of the blood flow velocity waveforms will be utilized to progressively increase accuracy of intracranial pressure estimation. The first will establish a basic estimate using shape features of individual waveform pulses, considered independent of neighboring pulses. Subsequently, clinically established features of the waveform will be utilized to learn causal changes in the shape features resulting from changes in intracranial pressure. Finally, the shape features in successive pulses will be used as a sequence to machine-learn the intracranial pressure estimate. Together, these will enable increased accuracy in estimation. All of the methods proposed in this program are entirely novel. This approach allows for real time monitoring at an affordable price point that is within current reimbursement limits for ultrasonography procedures.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a computer-based tutoring platform that adapts its teaching strategy to each student by monitoring their brain activity.  Access to individualized instruction by teachers or qualified tutors is limited for a vast number of students, particularly in disadvantaged areas and for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects.  Computer-based teaching technology could meet this demand, but currently relies on indirect inferences of a student's state, and therefore lacks some of the key abilities of human teachers to assess a student during a lesson.  This project will address this challenge by enabling the tutoring system to determine how hard students are thinking and their level of focus. This will be accomplished by measuring a student's brain electrical activity using a newly-developed headset designed specifically for school-aged children.  Information derived from brain activity patterns will be used to guide tutorial topic selection, difficulty of the content and the level of interactivity.  This project could lead to a significant advance in education technology by enhancing the adaptability of computer-based tutoring platforms and expanding the depth of information on student performance available to teachers and parents.  Adaptive computer-based education is now a rapidly growing market, and the technology developed in this project aims to provide companies with a unique capability to improve their products and to meet the need for truly scalable individualized tutoring.

    The unique innovation of this project is to create a tutoring platform that closes the loop with the student by adapting its teaching strategy to the student?s cognitive state.  To overcome the limitations of current adaptive tutoring systems, this product will measure the student's cognitive workload and engagement, and use this information to adapt aspects of the instructional strategy such as topic selection, content difficulty and interactivity in a closed-loop fashion.  The goals of this project are to modify current brain-wave measurement systems for use by children and young adults, extend associated computational algorithms and validate them to an industry standard, and evaluate the effect of adding brain-based metrics to student models that are at the core of adaptive technologies.  To meet these objectives, we will perform research and development to advance technologies for brain-activity monitoring, and conduct studies with students in grades 6 through 12 who will be tutored in subjects such as math, biology and history while their brain activity is recorded.  The results will be used to determine the effects of using brain activity data to improve the adaptability of computer-based tutors and expand the depth of information available to educational data analytics platforms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in Organic Rankine Cycles for distributed solar power generation at micro scale and will offer a cheaper alternative to solar photovoltaic (PV), with a payback period of just 4.5 year without government incentives. The use of solar thermal to generate power at residential level would offer a renewed encouragement to the solar thermal industry. With the ability to provide heat and hot water plus electricity, the solar thermal powered product would fulfill the energy requirements of a home single handedly. Most are familiar with the traditional perspective on the societal impact of a system like the Compact ORC - lower energy demand and reduced greenhouse gas. In addition the CORC positively impacts health and wellbeing by improving indoor air quality and providing affordable access. A number of clinical studies connect improved indoor air quality from efficient systems with a reduction in respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. Combining the health benefits of clean indoor air and improved living conditions, the downstream impact on healthcare cost would be enormous.

    This project attempts to solve the problem of high cost for renewable energy from solar energy, both PV and solar thermal, at the residential and light commercial level without government incentives. Solar thermal can provide heat and hot water but not electricity.  PV can provide electricity but not heat and hot water. The Compact ORC concept can do both with Combined Heat and Power (CHP). Current ORC systems are bulky and inefficient and most importantly high cost.  The objective of this research is to combine all of the components of the ORC in one compact, integrated, low cost package. The expander, pump, and generator will all be mounting on a common shaft. The evaporator and condenser heat exchangers will be mounted integral with the ORC reducing inefficiencies and packaging cost. There will be no external piping of components together. The result will be a compact unit that is cost and performance competitive with grid energy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to create a medical device capable of rapidly guiding treatment to stop bleeding in trauma patients. Trauma can affect the body's ability to form clots to stop bleeding. Of the more than 2 million severe cases of trauma in the U.S., approximately one third will develop a condition: trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which increases mortality 4-fold. TIC can be corrected; however, current tests to identify TIC take too long to effectively guide treatment. This leads to sub-optimal care and increased mortality and morbidity. The current standard-of-care to correct TIC is the transfusion of blood products. A patient should only be transfused if necessary because unnecessary transfusions can lead to complications resulting in longer hospital stays and even death. A rapid assay that can evaluate a trauma patient's coagulation status can help guide treatment of their injuries, resulting in improved standard-of-care that can both save lives and healthcare dollars. Yearly trauma rates unfortunately remain stable, and with an addressable market of more than $400M per year in the U.S., the commercial impact for such an assay is significant.

    The proposed project is to develop a rapid assay that provides an individualized assessment of a trauma patient's coagulation status. A significant subset of trauma patients develop impairment to the normal coagulation process as a result of their injuries. Current assays to identify this impairment take too long to effectively guide treatment. Therefore, successful completion of this project will yield a disposable microfluidic card (microcard) that has multiple advantages over current assays, which are slow and non-specific. The microcard will measure clot characteristics currently used by emergency room physicians to guide treatment, but will do so in less than five minutes. This is a critical feature as it quickly guides treatment, meaning that there is time for re-evaluation to determine if treatment is effective. The microcard will also include on-board positive and negative controls that indicate a patient?s individual coagulation profile. This will result in personalized and more accurate treatments that can reduce complications and mortality. The rapid and specific microcard assay will significantly improve care of injured patients while conserving resources and time, ultimately saving money for the U.S. healthcare system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the assistive use by blind people of thermal imaging. The resulting product provides a person who is blind or visually impaired with the relevant information about the layout of an unfamiliar public space in order to assist blind users in everyday activities. Thermal imaging can differentiate people and objects from their background without the need for complex image analysis. The shape and the temperature of the human body allows the location of people to be easily determined. The societal impact will be assisting users in navigation of complex public spaces. A blind person can use a smartphone?s haptic touchscreen display to examine the thermal image to determine the location of people in front of them. Information about the layout of an unfamiliar public space can be learned from the heat and shape of materials. Examples would be locating vending machines like ATMs and train passes. The market sector for this technology will likely extend beyond assisting blind users, to include additional commercial opportunities as well.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project will leverage past National Science Foundation Funded research to develop a product that a blind/low vision user can use to receive practical navigation and interaction information about their environment from a multimodal thermogram (thermal image) interface on a smartphone. There are no practical assistive technologies for blind or low vision users that allow them to locate people, objects, and the layout information of their surroundings other than exploring with a cane. This development will address the objective of creating an interface that provides both practical utility and will be accepted by the target demographic of blind users. This project represents an excellent translational path from NSF-sponsored research programs to a product that is built from the ground up on solid theoretical underpinnings and empirical findings from multimodal human information processing. This development will use thermal radiation from people, machines, lighting and heat retention differences in building materials and convert this data into a user interface to facilitate blind navigation and environment interaction. The product resulting will be a multimodal (kinesthetic, vibro-tactile, and auditory) interface for blind users of a smartphone to interpret and gain useful value from thermal image information.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in promoting the protection of human health, the environment, and our nation's natural resources by providing new sensors that enable fast, accurate, cost-effective sampling and analysis tools to monitor pollution and exposure. The innovations developed here will allow for the rapid identification and detection of hazardous compounds in water at substantially reduced cost. These technological innovations will translate into triple bottom-line savings of companies by enhancing our ability to protect people and the planet, while simultaneously providing cost and time savings to the business. The technology embodies the concepts of sustainability and ease of use, and will achieve broad commercial appeal by saving businesses money, time, and effort while also giving them more data on potential sources of pollution. Scientifically, this technology will enable more precise assessment of environmental pollution by providing more rapid measurement capability at a larger scale than is currently possible.


    This project will develop an innovative, market-disruptive technology for measuring toxic metals in water. This technology is inexpensive, portable, and does not require any power or external reading equipment. Furthermore, it can be adapted to a wide range of toxic compounds after initial commercialization around metals analysis. The system costs an order of magnitude less than the current "point of need" technologies capable of quantitative determination of toxic metals in water, and two orders of magnitude less than the traditional laboratory tests. Access Sensor Technologies is a new startup, but the core team has a strong track record in the field of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for environmental analysis where the proposed system represents a major innovation in the field. The proposal has four technical objectives: (1) Expand the palette of applicable chemistry to include additional metals: cadmium, lead, manganese, and both chromium 3+ and 6+; (2) Test the prototype system in a relevant laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment; (3) Achieve a successful customer-driven demonstration of the system in the field; and (4) Identify key elements of manufacturability that define the roadmap to production of the system at market scale.

    search to analogous (semantic) search to find relevant, adaptable solutions from
    other disciplines. Analogous search relies on the grammatical verb noun-phrase
    form, which describes the essential function needed to solve the problem (e.g.,
    reduce concussions). This grammatical form is then transformed into a set of related
    search phrases using synonyms, key semantic connections, and a proprietary taxonomy.
    The resulting search output contains more relevant, adaptable solutions to the
    problem at hand when compared to keyword search. The objectives and methods to
    be used include: incorporate a unique problem visualization process; add more
    data sources to Analogy Finder's search capabilities; enable Analogy Finder to
    search based on multiple verb noun-phrase combinations; develop new ways to organize
    and prioritize results; and begin identifying metrics to compare Analogy Finder's
    results with other search engines."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development and commercialization of a new technology for non-invasive preclinical imaging.  This platform technology will be used in studies of disease or in in drug development.  The project will further develop and validate an imaging platform based on three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, which is a low cost, high-throughput alternative to existing whole-body imaging modalities, and will provide more sensitivity and field of view than current two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound approaches.   The technology developed will reduce costs of whole-body preclinical imaging, and enable access to this technology to smaller research organizations.  Increased availability of a low-cost imaging tool for preclinical disease and drug development studies could accelerate progress in improving human health while reducing cost burdens on life science labs.

    The proposed project addresses the problem that 2D ultrasound is a preferred imaging modality in preclinical studies due to the adequate resolution, high throughput, and low cost; however, it suffers from user variability and inadequate field of view.  The research objectives will be to continue the development and validation of a 3D ultrasound system which overcomes challenges of user variability and inadequate field of view.  Specific technical goals will be to improve both the hardware and software of the system for increased throughput, integrating the system components into a cohesive customer-facing product, and calibrating and validating the system for its intended preclinical imaging application. Expected results will be a novel technology ? an automated 3D preclinical ultrasound system, which will substantially improve the performance and capabilities of preclinical ultrasound imaging, yet will retain the low-cost and high throughput characteristics of ultrasound imaging.  This new technology will fill a need present in nearly every academic research institution as well as pharmaceutical and contract research organizations worldwide.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a safe and effective cure for fungal

    utilized in other healthcare treatments such as skin and wound disinfection, decontamination
    of teeth and gums (oral hygiene), and the sterilization of medical instruments
    and implanted devices.  Fungal nail infection rates are growing at an estimated
    7% annually following both the general aging of the population and the rise in
    the incidence of diabetes. 50% of elderly over the age of 70 and 30% of all diabetics
    are affected. For many people, their infected nails are painful and embarrassing.
    Worst of all, diabetics with fungal nail infections are at increased risk for
    foot ulcerations, gangrene, and amputation. 38 million Americans suffer from nail
    fungal infections and spend over $3 billion dollars each year on treatments that
    are ineffective and sometimes unsafe. People suffering with nail fungal infections
    express widespread dissatisfaction with the limited success, side effects, high
    cost and inconvenience of current treatments.  \n\nThe proposed project will complete
    prototype development of a novel, safe, and effective treatment option for onychomycosis
    (nail fungal infection).  The medical device will allow a doctor to fumigate the
    infected nail with gas because gas can penetrate the nail and kill the fungus
    where all other treatments cannot reach. The human toe nail lacks a blood supply
    to deliver optimal immune system protection to fight off fungal infections. This
    project will develop a device that converts the air above the surface of the toe
    nail into the same gases used by the immune system to fight infection. Hence,
    the gas treatment would safely mimic the normal blood supply of anti-microbial
    chemicals. This SBIR project will reduce technical development risks, improve
    the device usability by doctors, and establish the manufacturability of the device.
    Device prototypes will be validated in the laboratory and with users (Podiatrists).
    The clinical-ready prototypes developed during this project will be used in future
    clinical trials that will prove the efficacy and safety of the device needed to
    sell the product. The device promises to fulfill the unmet medical need for a

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the automated manufacture of lightweight high-strength carbon fiber composite materials. Experts agree that composite manufacturers must lead innovations in sustainability, price reduction, and cycle-time reduction to meet end-market needs. The innovations proposed in this project, coupled with Vistex Composites' cutting edge Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process, directly address these needs by significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in composites manufacturing equipment. The prevailing motivation for short automated cycles is posed by the automotive industry, where lightweighting delivers major benefits for fuel consumption but where current processes cannot affordably and quickly produce carbon fiber automotive parts in large numbers. The equipment innovations proposed will not only enhance the automotive market but will have substantial commercial value across all composite markets as they allow the manufacture of equivalent quality products, faster, with less waste, significant energy savings, and at lower cost. Furthermore, the proposed automated process will enable Vistex in its aggressive path towards not only broader adoption of its Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process technology but also broader adoption of composite materials. This will directly drive manufacturing job creation, for Vistex and its customers, as composites displace foreign produced goods.


    This project addresses the design, fabrication, and analysis of an automated composite manufacturing cell using Vistex's patented Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process as the central technology. The standard composite manufacturing process, the autoclave, has long cycle times (hours), requires significant manual labor, and is expensive. Vistex's proposed manufacturing cell addresses these concerns. In the proposal manufacturing cell will be designed and fabricated to make a composite product using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling but where parts (1) can be moved rapidly and accurately using automation, (2) rapidly cured using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling, and (3) rapidly ejected/removed from the tooling, all while creating an equivalent or superior product to with significant cycle time savings over the industry's standard autoclave process. Through the use of material testing, cost analysis, and other metrics, each stage of the proposed manufacturing cell will be benchmarked against industry standard processes. The anticipated result will be a prototype turnkey rapid automated manufacturing cell and commercially usable products for project partners.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop a novel platform technology: a high-torque electrostatic motor (EM). This readily scalable platform machine technology can provide any desired torque or power rating necessary along with increased energy accessibility and reduced energy/operating costs compared to traditional steel-copper-magnet based motors. Instead of using permanent magnets or wire coil mechanisms, this motor exploits electrostatic forces between closely spaced, conductive metal plates to create an electric field, with shaft-torque capabilities far beyond those of conventional machines. By allowing industry more efficient operations, resources will be freed for continued innovation, spurring economic growth. This EM uses domestically-sourced materials like aluminum, steel, and plastic instead of rare earth elements like neodymium, dysprosium, or samarium used in traditional motors, thus reducing both dependence on foreign supply chains of rare earths and market volatility. EMs will be lighter-weight and less expensive to produce than traditional motors. Value is offered to numerous commercial markets, including electric/hybrid-electric cars, industrial automation, renewable energy (wind turbines), and machines operating in extreme environments (aerospace or down-hole drilling) through lower materials costs, increased reliability, higher efficiencies at low speed, and reduced weight.

    The Small Business Innovation Research Project (SBIR) Phase 2 project will expand understanding of electrostatic machinery, including operational principles, design principles, and strengths/weaknesses of this novel platform technology. This represents the first significant breakthrough in motor/machine technology in almost 150 years. Previously, electrostatic technology had few applications due to a limited body of knowledge, despite occasional study throughout the last century. This was primarily due to technological limitations (low capacitance, the necessity of vacuum used as an insulating medium), whose solution required knowledge spanning multiple technical fields (electric field theory, chemistry, mechanical engineering, material science, and power electronic controls). By addressing these technological limitations in P-I, this project already expanded the body of pertinent engineering and physics knowledge. This P-II project offers opportunities for additional study ranging far beyond those currently envisioned. For example, optimizing electrostatic/mechatronic systems such as sophisticated electrostatic drive systems will likely involve the use of highly-engineered materials (metamaterials and composites); next-generation 3D multiphysics simulation platforms to simultaneously solve fluid dynamic, electrostatic, and thermal behaviors; and development of chemical synthesis processes to maximize electrostatic force production. Advanced manufacturing technologies will likely emerge, leading to possibilities including injection molding or 3D printing of a machine.

    This SBIR Phase II project represents a revolutionary advance in adaptive educational technology systems by using data collected from previous exercises to automatically generate hints and feedback for students. This work addresses the SBIR Educational Technologies and Applications subtopic EA5 - Learning and Assessment by making adaptive learning widely available and by providing tools to assess student performance in order to make interventions as early as possible and help students succeed. While it is well known that adaptive Computer Based Training (CBT) is more efficient and more effective, it has traditionally been cost prohibitive to produce in most domains. By leveraging the latest research in Big Data analytics and Educational Data Mining (EDM), this project will produce adaptive capabilities automatically, dramatically reducing the costs of producing more effective training and making such training widely available. The core customers for this technology will be providers of training systems. This includes publishing organizations, developers of software tools for education, and providers of corporate and government training. Institutions that are struggling to educate students, particularly across STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, will be able to use this technology in their existing teaching systems and thus improve student engagement and performance.

    The final outcome of this project will be an integrated set of software tools that collect data from existing computer/web based training software, and automatically generate adaptive capabilities to create a personalized learning environment for students. It does this by using novel EDM and machine learning techniques to build and organize student and problem models that improve over time as more data is collected. It also provides for the tracking of student progress on specific concepts or skills (knowledge tracing), allowing for easy assessment at any point in time. The system also dynamically selects the students' next problems to maximize student learning and minimize time needed to master a set of skills (problem selection). For complex multi-step problems, this system will provide context-specific, just-in-time hints to help students as they learn. The final product will include data adapters that allow developers of existing software to seamlessly connect with this system. Finally, a main differentiator of this system is the transparent process of data curation and the related visualization tools that expose the problem- and student-model generation process. This combination of human input and machine learning will provide researchers, developers, and educators tools to explore student data and allow for new insights into how students learn.

    the lives of workers who bend and stoop while performing their jobs. These activities
    lead to back injuries which account of 36% of work place injuries. This project
    will result in an assistive technology to reduce injuries in these workers. There
    are many workers in shipbuilding and construction sites who perform tasks which
    cannot be assisted by available technology. Robotics and automation fields do
    not have solutions in the near horizon to automate these tasks. Therefore, workers
    are an essential part of these industries. The technology proposed here will make
    the workers? environment much more pleasant, prevent them from getting disabled
    and maintain their quality of life.  As back injuries cost the US alone 20 billion
    dollars annually in direct and indirect costs, the technology proposed will not
    only benefit workers but also employers. Addressing a pain point that costs billions
    of dollars globally each year gives this project strong commercial potential.
    The evaluations performed during this project will reveal the technology?s effect
    on workers? back. This will create an opportunity for other institutions to investigate
    fundamentals of human back pain or back injuries. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will improve the lives of workers and reduce financial
    burden on companies by developing a Trunk Support Exoskeleton (TSE) to reduce
    back injuries in workers caused by stooping and bending. Back injuries account
    for a large number of work place injuries. The goal of this project is to develop
    technologies based on user and customer recommendations, issues encountered during
    field evaluation, and experimentally evaluate the technology. The tasks include
    analysis, design and evaluation to reduce separation between the exoskeleton and
    the user, experiments and design to ease workers during prolonged low angle stooping
    and determining the requirements for walking while bending. It is expected that
    these features will make the technology more attractive and useable to users and
    customers. In addition, to evaluating the technology to validate the features
    above, experiments to quantify the performance of the technology during activities
    similar to those that workers would encounter will be performed. It is expected
    that the technology will reduce the participants? strain on their lower back without
    reducing their performance."

    inherently efficient manufacturing methods.  Markets that have expressed keen

    This understanding is critical for controlling many processes that depend on wetting
    phenomena, including printing, adhesive bonding, painting, rapid prototyping and
    additive manufacturing, application of agricultural chemicals, and aircraft deicing.
    \ \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address

    adhesives and coatings to water-borne systems, which has made the control of surface
    treatment extremely critical. Currently, surface treatment processes are performed
    without feedback control.  The quality of surface treatment is determined by expensive
    destructive testing.  The proposed sensor is based on ultra rapid determination

    and energetics of a substrate surface, and the equilibrium drop geometry, and
    utilize this knowledge to design and construct prototype closed loop control surface
    processing equipment. This understanding will be developed primarily through high-speed
    imaging of the interaction of growing droplets with surfaces of various chemical

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is a new product for improving the performance of existing machinery. If this project is successful, numerous industrial and commercial applications will benefit from increased component longevity and more efficient operation of machinery, coupled with labor and energy savings. From a societal perspective, this technology has the potential to save a large portion of the substantial amount of energy lost to friction in ubiquitous components such as generators and engines, while simultaneously reducing wear-related material/component failures and associated downtime costs. Previous research has predicted that a successful global application of the proposed technology in existing transportation systems will enable an absolute energy savings that exceeds the total energy generated by all currently-deployed photovoltaic, geothermal, and biomass sources combined.

    This project will focus on the further development and scale-up of ceramic nanosheets with structurally different sides (sticky/slick), which will be used to form a self-generating tribological thin film coating for improved lubrication.  This coating is formed during normal operation, particle by particle. The creation of these low-friction tribological coatings has been previously observed but requires further optimization for robustness and additional engineering and testing for commercial applications. Understanding the influence of composition and surface dopants is required for market application of the resulting, nearly frictionless coatings.  Additional material testing and successful scale-up of the production of these nanosheets are needed for commercial viability.  Follow-on applications of these anisotropic nanostructures are envisioned in the areas of catalyst supports, plastic fillers, and smart materials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve the care of cancer patients by providing an integrated platform for clinical data and image analytics to their care providers for better clinical decision making. Tight integration of clinical data with radiology images will enable evidence-based approaches to be used by care providers in oncology. The tools being developed in this project will enable accelerated transition of comprehensive data-driven cancer research into clinical practice for decision making related to diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Recent trends, such as wide adoption of electronic medical records and radiological images and availability of powerful computing at reasonable prices have made it possible to improve the prognostic and diagnostic power of data, in particular imaging data analysis in healthcare.  The integrated analytics platform being developed will streamline treatment monitoring by imaging and reduce diagnostic errors; hence increasing the quality to cancer care.

    The proposed project aims to develop an integrated, minable, clinical and imaging data analytics platform for oncology. The platform combines recent advances in data mining, context search, image segmentation and deformable registration into an imaging system deployed at the point of care. The diagnostic potential of clinical and image data will be enhanced by the ability to compare lesion characteristics of the current case to a large repository of lesions from other studies with known diagnosis. The proposed search tool will generate patient cohorts with a given set of diagnosis and treatment conditions and present the related images to the diagnostician. Additional technology will locate and track tumors and provide detailed characterization such as size, shape, location and texture with detailed analytics. A large, minable database of segmented tumors and detailed metrics will advance research into identifying ?imaging biomarkers?. The embedded imaging platform will allow clinicians to access these decision support tools across a wide spectrum of devices from powerful personal computers to tablets and other mobile devices.

    also has broader impact in the field of nanofabrication and nanomedicine development.
    \n\nThe proposed project will enable the red blood cell membrane-coated nanoparticles
    to be manufactured efficiently and reliably at a large scale toward clinical translation.
    To ensure that the manufactured nanoformulations will have the optimal size, uniformity,
    biological activity, and performance, advanced fluidics, filtration, microscopy,
    and particle tracking techniques will be applied for precision nanoparticle preparation
    and characterization. Specifically, the proposed research activity will focus
    on the synthesis of uniform polymeric nanoparticles with consistent physicochemical
    properties, derivation of purified and undisrupted red blood cell membranes, and
    reliable cell membrane coating over the nanoparticle substrates. The resulting
    nanoparticles will be thoroughly examined to iteratively improve the preparation
    process. Optimized manufacturing protocol will be developed for large-scale production
    of high quality nanoformulations following good manufacturing practices (GMP).
    The project will facilitate the bench-to-bedside transition of the novel biomimetic
    nanoparticle platform, which has significant implications in addressing the many
    major diseases involving protein toxins."

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on robot systems designed for early childhood education (preK-2). There is increasing research and applications for educational robotics, but little attention are focused on the foundational years. The early childhood segment is underserved because there are few available platforms for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education that are developmentally appropriate for children 4-7 years old. However, research shows that from an economic and a developmental standpoint, educational programs that begin in early childhood result in lower costs and more durable effects than those that begin later on. This project focuses on developmentally appropriate robot kits for young children, and the curriculum support, teacher resources and automated assessment tools to make this innovation useful for early childhood education in a broadly disseminated, sustainable and scalable way. Recent re-envisioning of early childhood programs by the Federal government has resulted in calls to develop innovative technologies and approaches for teaching STEM. Given the size of the industry devoted to early childhood education, the potential commercial impact is significant, opening new markets and job opportunities.  This innovation also has the potential to have significant positive impact on the US economy by preparing children with economically important skills.


    The innovation underlying this project is the design of a robot system that engages 4 to 7 year old children in learning programming concepts through the use of a developmentally appropriate programming language. In order to be developmentally appropriate for this age range, the programming language is physical, not typed, with no screens or keyboards of any kind required. The resulting educational platform also enables children to develop engineering design process skills by building physical objects that can respond to different inputs through the use of sensors. This project is organized around five technical objectives: a developmentally appropriate robot kit for young children to learn programming and engineering; robot modules for curriculum integration with other areas such as math, science, literacy and the arts; support systems for early childhood teachers through a web portal with resources for both formal and informal education and professional development strategies; and an automated learning assessment system that collects data characterizing student learning directly from the robot, analyzes it through innovative mechanisms and displays it using visualization tools according to the different needs of parents, educators and school leadership to understand learning outcomes; and cost reduction of the robot system for broadening adoption.

    to answer the presidential call to \"create digital tutors that are as effective
    as personal tutors.\" More than any other subject, mathematical learning is cumulative,
    and as students fall behind their classmates, new material becomes less comprehensible
    and they can face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment (FA)
    practices have been well established as effective in closing these gaps and informing
    teacher decision-making. While the influx of mobile computing devices has enormous
    potential to help facilitate change in education, the potential is heavily dependent
    on the availability of proven, research-backed software and services. This project
    will help close achievement gaps by providing students with adaptive, personalized
    instruction and also providing teachers with valuable FA techniques, data, and
    suggestions. More broadly, the data will yield opportunities to research and model
    student understanding and to analyze the learning process, enabling additional
    research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics.
    With its strong customer value propositions and innovations that will enable new
    forms of software-enhanced teaching and learning, this project will also create
    significant commercial value within the educational market. \n\nThis project will
    create digital learning environments that go beyond current state-of-the-art systems
    to deliver adaptively selected instructional video segments and highly interactive
    problems, and do so while maintaining a flow of content that feels natural - as
    if the learning was occurring in the presence of an actual tutor. The ability
    of the system to adapt to the needs of an individual student is based upon a real-time
    assessment of student understanding and leverages cutting edge research from the
    fields of formative assessment, machine learning, artificial intelligence and
    big data. The ability to model student understanding and analyze the learning
    process will lead to the creation of new learning analytics tools and enable additional
    research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics.
    The proposed research will seek to demonstrate, in a randomized crossover trial,
    the effectiveness of the adaptive, online system over a control treatment. The
    researched solutions will also employ novel FA implementations such as collaborative
    review and white-boarding (via wireless communication), record and playback of
    teacher work, use of student sentiment, groupings of peers for collaborative work,
    and models of student understanding that incorporate teacher input (teacher plus
    software in the FA loop)."

    K-12 students in inquiry-based learning not only in STEM education but across
    the curriculum.  The coming of the information age has mandated radical changes
    in the skills set required for 21st century. To teach these skills, as articulated
    in the Common Core Standards, teachers are expected to target students? ability
    to conduct short as well as more sustained research projects. The Internet is
    not only the obvious go-to place for teaching these skills but one of the reasons
    for mandating them. It is the easy access to vast amounts of information that
    has made it possible for everyone to conduct research, analyze data and build
    new knowledge. The problem, however, is that the Internet is not a library with
    reliable and catalogued information that can be searched by topic and, in school
    libraries, by reading level. The development of the proposed technology, a personalized
    librarian on-demand, solves this problem. It offers unprecedented opportunity
    for learners of all ages to engage in inquiry, it enables differentiated learning
    and gives learners a life-long tool to help them understand and critically engage
    with digital information. The target market is not limited to the U.S. The developed
    linguistic algorithms apply to non-English, allowing early targeting of the international
    market by building web curators for other languages. \n\n\nThis project blends
    research on linguistics, psychology of reading, natural language processing (NLP)
    \ and machine learning. Innovative NLP technology is used to detect age-appropriate
    sites that are relevant to the curriculum. The developed technology analyzes the
    reading difficulty and thematic content of websites automatically in real time
    search. The purpose of the system is to make adaptive individualized recommendations
    that match the student's reading level and are appropriate for her current familiarity
    with the topic. The patent pending adaptive component is built using machine learning
    and collaborative filtering methods. The resulting research tool, a personalized
    web curator, is based on novel methods for modeling the student's familiarity
    with the topic of web resources. These methods are extended to include novel analysis
    of video content. Unlike other adaptive educational products, the system's adaptive
    recommendations do not rely on obtaining test scores from the user and corresponding
    them to  pre-labeled, leveled data. The complete solution includes an integrated
    gamified experience that helps the students acquire basic and advanced research
    skills and develop the habit of applying them consistently. The project team includes
    educational technology experts from academia and schools and conducts extensive
    studies evaluating learning benefits by the afforded differentiation in instruction,
    including special education programs and English Language Learners."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to accelerate the pace
    of research and development to enable more rapid deployment of technologies
    into commercial / industrial contexts. In many fields, information is expanding at
    such an exponential rate that finding relevant results to technical knowledge
    searches is increasingly difficult. Further, content is expanding so fast that most
    fields are rapidly forming sub-disciplines, leading to the ?silo-ing? of different
    knowledge sub-domains, a clear challenge to both academia and industry. We
    need ever better ways to organize and present information to users. There are
    disadvantages of the current search engines, mostly relating to excessive
    similarity in search results. Further, while these engines present information
    relating to a known search target, they are less effective at presenting
    unexpected results for information that a user has never heard of but that would
    be useful. What is therefore needed is an exploration system giving searchers a
    strong serendipitous element with a maximum likelihood of results from diverse,
    unexpected, and potentially provocative sources. This will break down silos by
    providing a rapid, relevant means for knowledge-transfer between different
    disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary innovation. This system has been designed
    to provide a means for systematic, automated discovery.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is focused on
    optimizing and scaling a serendipitous document search system for repurposing
    technologies by analogy into lateral fields. Both by sub-parsing discrete content
    into ontologically separable entities, such as capability, characteristic, and
    composition, and by comparatively assessing certain of these attributes between
    such entities, the attribute relatedness of these entities can be used to drive their
    self-assembly into related attribute networks. This approach provides a
    significant value proposition for drug repurposing, which is the current focus of
    this project. To scale the pair-wise comparison and network assembly of millions
    of documents, a map-reduce based text-processing framework will be developed
    so that massively parallel computations can be carried out in a time- and costefficient
    manner. A distributed search engine technology will be deployed to
    enable rapid querying of the emerging document relationship network. A series of
    machine learning algorithms will then be used to determine potentially hidden
    structural architectural features within the document relationship network.
    Machine learning will elucidate the nature of the relationships in drug networks
    through analyses of inter-node relationships and sub-graph motifs (termed
    ?innovation motifs?). Documents including U.S. patents and scientific papers will
    be processed in the system.

    it will be a powerful new tool for advancing knowledge in the fields of mechanisms

    (SBIR) project is to develop and prototype a novel magnetic sensor capable of
    continuous detection of the small magnetic signals generated by the human heart.
    The proposed technology enables heart-rate and heart waveform detection without
    any contact to the skin, contrary to standard electrocardiograph (ECG) based devices
    that require uncomfortable electrodes, adhesives and chest straps to operate.
    Furthermore, this technology can be manufactured at low cost and easily miniaturized.
    The goal of the project is to provide a contactless, unobtrusive and comfortable
    way to evaluate the heart condition, to be used by sports enthusiasts for fitness
    heart monitoring, and for heart disease patients that require an accurate, continuous
    and long-term heart monitoring solution. The proposed technology is designed to
    be easy integrated with bracelets, smart-watches, or simply placed in a pocket,
    while constantly measuring the heart function. Its small size and low cost enables
    the broad use of this technology and easy integration with available wearables.
    Moreover, knowing that heart disease is the main cause of death in developed nations,
    we believe our low cost and easy to use device will have positive impact on public
    health, and on preventive medicine. Better preventive care will consequently help
    to lower healthcare costs. \n\nThe proposed project will focus on the development
    of a novel magnetic sensor for continuous and portable monitoring of the human

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that more patients will benefit from minimally
    invasive surgery, in which operations are completed through tiny incisions.  In
    addition to patient benefits of less postsurgical pain, less scarring, and quicker
    recovery, minimally invasive surgery also reduces healthcare cost due to shorter
    hospital stays and lower risk of post-operative complications. Minimally invasive
    surgery impacts all surgical specialties, including gynecology, general, bariatric,
    urologic, and cardiothoracic. Although more than 1.5 million such procedures are
    performed in the US each year, wider adoption is limited by the high cost of current
    surgical robots, training burden of traditional hand-held instruments, and complexity
    of certain minimally invasive procedures. The technology developed via this project
    will enable surgeons to perform complex minimally invasive procedures such as
    hysterectomy with minimal training and at a fraction of the cost of surgical robots.
    Surgeons will benefit from this ergonomic design that will significantly reduce
    the incidence of workplace related injury associated with many laparoscopic instruments.
    This development effort will lead to a versatile platform technology that can
    impact nearly all kinds of surgeries enabling a wider adoption of minimally invasive

    needle driver. This novel low-cost minimally invasive surgery technology provides
    enhanced dexterity and intuitive control that is seen only in multi-million dollar
    surgical robots. Minimally invasive surgery is performed through small holes on
    a patient?s body to minimize trauma, blood loss, and recovery time, and generally
    involves suturing, knot-tying, and fine dissection, all of which would benefit
    from enhanced dexterity in the surgical instrument. Currently available low-cost
    mechanical (non-robotic) instruments either lack dexterity or are counter-intuitive
    to operate, resulting in surgeon fatigue and significant training requirements.
    Robotic instruments provide exceptional dexterity and intuitive control, but are
    costly and beyond the reach of many hospitals and patients. The proposal minimally
    invasive surgery technology platform overcomes this affordability versus functionality
    tradeoff via a novel forearm mounted tool configuration and innovations in parallel-kinematic
    virtual center mechanisms that makes the tool input joint coincident with the
    surgeon?s wrist. This results in a natural and intuitive motion transmission from

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an improvement in public health and quality of life through improved methods of medicinal therapy.  The technology developed in this project is aimed at improving the effectiveness of existing therapeutic drugs while facilitating their use by patients in need of treatment, as well as enabling the development of promising new therapeutic agents and regiments that otherwise would not be useful due to the required frequency or complexity of their administration.  As an example, if successful this technology will take a drug requiring daily injection (or multiple injections every day) and convert it to a form that requires injection only once-weekly.  The anticipated societal impact is increased patient compliance together with an improvement in the effectiveness of the treatment, and thus an overall improvement in patient quality of life.  The replacement of existing treatment regimens by more convenient and effective ones is expected to have a substantial commercial impact, as is the enablement of new therapeutics to treat currently untreated or ineffectively-treated conditions.

    The proposed project is aimed at developing a platform technology based on the controlled release of drugs, particularly peptides and proteins, from an injected depot.  Current methods are either incompatible with peptides and proteins due to their mode of manufacture or chemical reactivity, or do not provide the precise control over release and degradation rates that are needed for optimum therapeutic efficiency. The methods proposed will develop a biodegradable hydrogel matrix that is readily injected, that releases a bound drug in a highly controlled manner, and which subsequently dissolves in a highly controlled manner.  The hydrogel matrix provides a protein-friendly environment, and use of ?Ò-eliminative linkers results in precise control of release and degradation kinetics. Technology development will be focused on the chemistry of drug attachment for generalized peptides/proteins as well as the chemistry for the hydrogel matrix itself, but will be exemplified using specific therapeutic peptides having existing therapeutic applications, such as exenatide and GLP-1 that are of immediate applicability to the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and obesity.  Concomitantly, methods for the in vivo analysis of hydrogel behavior will be developed, and tolerability of the hydrogel matrix will be assessed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. The proposed technology could drastically improve the overall effectiveness of pest management programs in various agricultural industries. The proposed system not only eliminates one of the most laborious and dreaded activities of manually inspecting insect traps, but also provides unprecedented access to accurate, real-time insect population information to make more effective pest management decisions. This leads to reduced, spatially-restricted pesticide applications, better understanding of insect pest behaviors, and enhanced biological control. The automated trap?s ability to monitor more than one species of insect not only achieves a higher level of efficiency in pest monitoring but also multiplies the technology?s value to the end users. The potential market for the proposed technology is quite broad. In fact, the technology can benefit any industry that requires regular monitoring of insect populations. Furthermore, the proposed technology could be used for various state and federal pest monitoring programs, such as the Slow the Spread (STS) Project administered by USDA to monitor gypsy moths.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes to develop a multi-modal sensor platform for robust detection and classification of multiple insect pest species for automated monitoring of insect populations in production agriculture. The main goal of this project is two-fold: First is to demonstrate that bio-impedance sensor alone provides useful data to classify multiple insect species. A linear support vector machine classifier using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients extracted from bio-impedance data will be implemented on an embedded platform for detection and classification of two insect pest species. These bio-impedance based electronic traps will undergo large-scale field trials and be prepared for full commercialization. The second objective is to develop a multi-modal electronic trap with ultrasound, infrared and bio-impedance sensors that can simultaneously monitor four or more insect pest species. Measurement signals generated by the sensors will be analyzed to determine a set distinct features that can be computed on an embedded platform for real-time processing. These features will then be used in multi-modal sensor fusion algorithms for robust detection and classification. Different sensor fusion strategies will be investigated and the performance of each fusion algorithm will be evaluated both in controlled and field conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can strongly influence the healthcare system. The technology of the proposed project has the potential to make a broader impact by decreasing the risk of performing the bone graft harvesting procedure compared to current methods and consequently increase the number of surgeons who choose to collect a patient?s own bone graft in lieu of using inferior bone graft alternatives/substitutes. Furthermore, whereas fewer new, inexperienced surgeons are currently being trained to utilize the patient?s own bone graft because of the risks of current harvesting methods, these surgeons may be encouraged to perform the harvesting procedure with the introduction of the proposed concept. The increase in use of the patient?s own bone will benefit patients because of the widely accepted clinical benefits of autogenous bone graft compared to synthetic or exogenous alternative solutions. The proposed technology may also have a significant commercial impact to hospitals because of potential decreases in operating room time and post-operative patient hospitalization time (compared to the standard harvesting procedure) as well as decreased per-procedure product costs (compared to substitute bone graft products).

    The proposed project addresses the important unmet clinical need of enabling orthopaedic surgeons to collect bone graft from the patient?s pelvic bone in a minimally invasive manner without the patient morbidity and added surgical time intrinsic to the current standard bone graft harvesting methods. The research objectives of the proposed project are to explore various design enhancements to the minimum viable product and assess the impact of these changes on the value proposition; and to explore adjustments to the minimum viable product and assess their fit for use in additional surgical procedures not accessible by the minimum viable product. These objectives will be completed by investigating various new product features and manufacturing processes as well as testing these concepts in various pre-clinical settings. This project has strong intellectual merit because this transformative technological concept has the potential to disrupt the current methods that surgeons employ for harvesting bone graft by introducing a novel solution that improves patient outcomes, surgical time, and hospital costs.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is multi-fold: First, the proposed tripolar concentric
    ring electrode and instrumentation for acquiring brain signals, tripolar electroencephalography
    (tEEG), is a platform technology that has a variety of medical and commercial
    applications. By providing significantly clearer brain signals, tEEG will resolve
    conventional EEG?s major drawback of poor signal quality that clinicians and researchers
    have been struggling with for decades. tEEG can advance diagnosis and fill unmet
    clinical and research needs such as detection of biomarkers to quantify various
    neurological disorders. Second, commercially, tEEG can transform the market landscape
    and set a new standard for EEG equipment. The fundamental improvement promised
    by tEEG and its non-invasive nature are particularly appealing. tEEG could greatly
    simplify and advance the diagnosis of a wide spectrum of neurological disorders
    (epilepsy, sleep disorders, stroke, Parkinson?s, Alzheimer?s, etc.) and more effectively
    guide neurosurgical and other medical procedures. Third, the fundamental improvement
    in spatial resolution and artifacts rejection in EEG signals will help advance
    the understanding of brain activity, leading to new discoveries in the research
    of various brain diseases and neurological disorders. \n\nThe proposed project
    aims to develop a portable tripolar concentric ring electrode (TCRE) electroencephalography
    (tEEG) recording system and perform a comprehensive clinical evaluation to demonstrate
    that tEEG can detect certain important brain EEG signals better than conventional
    EEG. EEG is the primary diagnostic tool for epilepsy, the most common serious
    brain disorder worldwide, but misdiagnosis occurs in up to 50% of the patients.
    Artifact contamination seriously hinders the effectiveness of EEG and is a root
    cause of misdiagnosis. tEEG automatically suppresses artifacts and increases the
    interpretability of EEG through two inventions: (1) a transformative electrode
    configuration - the TCRE; and (2) the proprietary tEEG Interface and digitizer.
    The TCRE, tEEG Interface, and digitizer together comprise a complete, Portable
    tEEG system with the data stored and displayed on a laptop. In this project, clinicians
    will evaluate tEEG against conventional EEG in areas such as usability, ability
    to suppress artifacts, and superiority in seizure detection. If successful, tEEG
    would generate intense interest in the field because of the significant clinical
    and research impact. We expect that comparing tEEG and EEG in a clinical setting
    will demonstrate the superiority of tEEG for diagnosing epilepsy."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide enhanced vision for patients after cataract surgery.  Current devices, called intraocular lenses (IOLs), can correct certain vision problems.  However, commercially available IOLs do not provide the same restoration of capabilities as other surgeries, such as hip replacements.  In particular, current IOLs do not address the problems of presbyopia which is the continual degradation of the ability to change focus from far to near object which eventually results in the need for reading glasses.  Devices that attempt to address presbyopia, but fail, represent a $500MM current market.  This project has a novel approach to the problem and the opportunity to positively affect the lives of the 3 million people each year that are undergoing cataract surgery.

    The proposed project will continue to push the bounds of our understanding of the mechanisms of human vision control.  Previous work done to measure the forces in the eye used to change vision from near to far objects, will be utilized in the design and testing of an IOL that can truly provide changes in vision like the normal lens of a 30 year old human.  Several iterations of design will be tested in a rhesus monkey model to determine the best way to capture the forces in the eye, the optimal design of the shape of the device and materials used, the choice of optic material, and the procedures to insert and activate the IOL.  All with the objective to turn currently available forces in the eye into refractive changes in eyesight.  The ultimate goal of this project is to have a design that can be used for an FDA application for human clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a cornerstone for reliable electricity and a modernized grid able to evolve alongside emerging customer demands. Reliable electricity is key component of an industrialized market, critical for the information age, and an enabler for non-industrialized regions evolution and eventual world economic contribution.  The societal benefit therefore of GridBridge's commercially feasible Grid Energy Router is colossal, as it is the step-function change required to truly orchestrate a grid to match this era.  This project will enable numerous hindered technologies and scientific understanding related to energy storage, photovoltaic and other renewable generation, as well as electric vehicles and their correlated fast chargers.  Energy savings are also a monumental aspect and are expected to be in the trillions of dollars.  Society needs electricity to maintain civilization and an updated grid is imperative for supplying that electricity to an evolved consumer base.  GridBridge?s Grid Energy Router will be the crucial component for the modernized grid an enabler for numerous complementary technologies.  GridBridge's GER will eventually replace millions of installed legacy grid technologies throughout the world.  Furthermore, the continued GridBridge-ERC relationship establishes FREEDM ERC's commercialization ecosystem, which includes 200 diverse students.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project combines various research aspects to commercialize the company?s third breakthrough product for electric utilities, the Grid Energy Router (GER).  GridBridge?s Grid Energy Router will be cornerstone for an evolved grid that can integrate renewables and storage, offer dynamic efficiency gains, and intelligently route power.  Although there has been early work with power electronics merely focusing in the area of high-voltage conversion, the approaches thus far limit commercialization and manufacturability.  GridBridge will combine over three years of company market research and utility voice of the customer, a unique product roadmap, and cutting edge research in the areas of feature implementation and voltage conversion.  Keeping in mind the end market, electric utility requirements have been incorporated: highly efficient, cost-competitive, manufacturable within a specific market window, and scalable both to high power and high voltage.  This project facilitates a cost-effective and electrically-efficient product design ready for industrialization and ultimately grid integration, while simultaneously incorporating valuable features that justify utility expenditure and meet a market window of need.

    that creates interactive learning content for university-level science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The interactive content, featuring animations,
    interactive question sets, and online tools, along with some text, may replace
    or enhance traditional textbooks, with studies showing significant improvements
    in student engagement and learning outcomes. The project addresses the nationwide
    high dropout rates of STEM students, due in part to outmoded learning materials.
    Such dropout rates not only prevent students from achieving their career goals,
    but result in a shortage of college graduates in nationally-critical STEM fields.
    The project creates novel web-based tools that empower teachers, and even students,
    to straightforwardly contribute new interactive content, thus tapping the latent
    talent and energy of many thousands of people. The project creates automated and
    human-overseen processes that efficiently and effectively percolate the highest-quality
    contributions to the top of lists, enabling content to be created and maintained
    at large scale and low cost. The project's new publishing paradigm can disrupt
    the existing publishing industry. The interactive quality content can increase
    the number of students who successfully graduate in STEM fields, which can strengthen
    the nation's economy and competitiveness. \n\nThe project develops a new web-based
    content authoring and delivery framework that supports a novel curated-crowdsourced
    publishing paradigm. The framework tightly integrates collaborative web-based
    authoring with delivery of animated interactive web-based content. The project
    develops elegant tools for instructors, and even students, to contribute new interactive
    items. Such tools include a novel browser-based animation creation tool, which
    allows powerful animations to be easily and quickly created via any web browser
    without requiring application installation or requiring extensive tool training.
    The project creates and tests new processes that, via a combination of peer evaluations,
    usage data, and assessments, automatically percolate quality contributions to
    the top, for final curation by instructors, authors, or editors. Such percolation
    crowdsourcing can yield superior learning materials, at scale and cost-effectively,
    while simultaneously yielding substantially lower prices than traditional textbooks."

    and social networking functionality into technologies used in online education
    and webinars. Researchers have long identified engagement as the key ingredient
    for success in any learning environment and particularly the online environment,
    but current online teaching systems lack the means by which instructors can gauge
    their students' level of engagement because these students are not visible. Therefore
    in order to improve current online teaching modalities, it is necessary to find
    ways to communicate to the instructor the level of engagement of their unseen
    online students. The successful outcome of the project will allow the lecturer
    to receive real-time feedback from facial expressions, gaze and other body kinesics,
    which when averaged across the virtual classroom, provides feedback related to
    the reception of information delivery. The project supports NSF's mission in education,
    which seeks to answer questions about how teachers can provide effective cognitive
    and motivational support for students. This project aims to promote richer interactions
    between tutor and online students through integrated cognitive and motivational
    scaffolding, leading to higher levels of student success enabling them to compete
    more effectively as skilled artisans in the 21st century workforce. \n \n \nThis
    project contributes four significant innovations: a machine-vision recognition
    system for gaze direction and facial expressions of engagement, which aggregates
    data across participants to improve signal to noise; a machine-vision recognition
    system for detecting hand gestures and postural kinesics; enabling third party
    pedagogical applications within a framework using ancillary hardware, and which
    can be sold through an educational application store; and to integrate social
    network functionality that replicates pre- and post-lecture socialization including
    pair sharing, breakout groups, team teaching, and support for online teaching
    assistance. The goals and scope of research required to support the above innovations
    include: improving machine-vision classifier data and functionality; optimization
    of user interface and integrated user calibration process; extending the system's
    functionality to both synchronous and asynchronous modalities; developing neuro-psychological
    and cognitive models of the online pedagogical process; design and integration
    of content/media interoperability and social networking capabilities; creation
    of open application programming interfaces for third-party developers and application
    store functionality with digital whiteboards and tablets; development of ancillary
    software modules to help students manage data related to their educational efforts,
    diagnose study and achievement patterns, and provide expert advice based on that

    compounds (VOC) are released during incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, the
    manufacture of a range of chemicals, and the process of petrochemical refining.
    Entanglement Technologies proposes to complete development of a BTEX and butadiene
    vapor analyzer based on the combination of cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS)
    and diffusion time-of-flight (DiTOF). CRDS provides extremely sensitive detection
    while diffusion provides specificity. The research objective of this project is

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project should offer a radically new alternative to enterprises for application mobilization.  The key value proposition is the ability for companies to mobilize their applications at a fraction of the cost and time as compared to any competitive offering.  From a technology standpoint, the project consists of a cloud-based backend that allows for the original PC version (browser-based or thick-client-based) of enterprise applications to be run, a front-end app that runs on the mobile devices, and a purpose-built remote computing protocol called MORPH.  The protocol is specifically designed to dynamically transform the application views in a manner that make them appropriate for smartphones and tablets.  The platform enables mobilization without requiring any software development, mobilizes applications instantaneously, offers a unified mobilization platform for all of an enterprise's applications, and enables feature parity controllable by the enterprise.  MORPH composes of two underlying technologies:  1) virtual view that virtualizes application views independent of the UI framework used into a set of UI elements and attributes that can be easily manipulated, and 2) transformation services that can be programmed onto the StarMobile platform to operate on the virtual view to realize a mobile device friendly view.

    The broader / commercial impact of this project is that a company can take any current enterprise applications and extend them to users on any mobile devices at 5% to 20% of the cost and time of any other solution on the market today.  This should benefit the 85% of enterprise knowledge workers who are expected to have smartphones within the next few years.  A recent survey of CIOs revealed that there are multiple drivers for application mobilization - the key ones being increased productivity of employees, higher revenue, and reduced paper work.  Over 90% of IT managers in a recent survey indicated plans for application mobilization.  Typical customers for StarMobile include Global 2000 businesses that use on-premise, web-based and / or cloud-based applications, packaged or bespoke, to support their business processes.  While there is an urgent demand for application mobilization, there are no reliable, cost-effective solutions that can perform mobilization rapidly.  Thus, there is a need for a solution that can achieve rapid mobilization with minimal effort on the part of the enterprise and at the same time provide the rich set of functionality that is required.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the rapidly growing threats to endpoint security from attacks and data loss over USB. At present, virtually all USB security measures are located as software on the host or as a secured physical device. Neither of these approaches is truly capable of addressing the vulnerability as a whole - software solutions can be bypassed and a physical peripheral device cannot secure the data that is transmitted on the bus. The proposed technology is located next to the host, so it is capable of securing the entire bus. Our specific technical objectives include the construction of a security device capable of stopping representative attacks in the USB Threat Model that are not solved by existing solutions. Such a device would enable a disruptive improvement in the field of USB cybersecurity. The anticipated results for proposed project will be the development of the product for deployment to customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project would be a disruptive change to USB security. USB security has become critical for many organizations with secure networks, especially healthcare, financial, and defense institutions. The number of data loss incidents over USB has exploded with the availability of smart devices and tablets. USB attacks compromised Predator drones in 2011 using USB drives, and the Military has implemented USB bans, degrading productivity and increasing costs. Despite USB bans, attacks and data loss over USB continue. The proposed device is capable of providing unprecedented levels of security to USB and a framework to build future security infrastructure. To stimulate continued innovations in security and mobile devices markets, we plan to open our platform to the greater scientific and commercial community to develop the next generation of algorithms to stop attacks and data loss over USB. Since our device provides access to USB data with an API, it can enable students and professionals to rapidly ramp up their understanding of USB without the need of expensive hardware and proprietary software. Our device can be integrated inside PCs and smart devices, which would impact the security of every computer, smart device, networks and the ?cloud?.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a novel self-sealing materials technology for the primary application of designing durable blood access systems for hemodialysis patients.  Nearly 580,000 people in the United States alone have end stage renal disease (ESRD), and over 400,000 people are treated using hemodialysis as the primary mode of treatment.  Current access systems are neither designed for repeated access nor managing bleeding after hemodialysis treatment, and as a result commonly lead to secondary complications.  The research aims of the proposal are to:  1) Develop manufacturing methods for device production, 2) Determine biocompatibility of the materials technology, and 3) Develop an animal model to evaluate potential clinical impact.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will yield a unique and novel material that will create a paradigm shift from the treatment of complications due to hemodialysis to prevention.  This will address clinical market needs and shift reimbursement policies to create better clinical outcomes and contain costs.  Currently, $27 billion is spent on the delivery of hemodialysis treatment for ESRD patients.  The materials technology under development will lead to vascular access devices suitable for nearly the entire hemodialysis patient population, thereby creating an estimated addressable market size of more than $500 million.  This research will enhance scientific understanding by introducing novel engineering and manufacturing methods for a broad range of applications beyond hemodialysis where repeated access and reliable sealing is required.

    This Small Business Innovations Research Phase (SBIR) II project is to support the continued development of using proprietary perfusion decellularization technology to create a fully revascularized cardiac patch for the treatment of ischemic heart disease and congenital heart repair. Current surgical approaches for cardiac reconstruction utilize synthetic materials that do not have the ability to grow and remodel with the patient.  Feasibility will be demonstrated by in-vitro and in-vivo characterization to create a perfusable cardiac-derived revascularized cardiac patch to promote faster reconstruction of functional tissue by providing a fully perfusable scaffold with a composition and architecture similar to native cardiac tissue.  This product will have significant advantages over existing technologies, including: 1) full thickness, biological, cardiac-derived matrix material; 2) vascular supply to support migrating cells and remodeling; 3) superior mechanical properties; and, 4) no need for immunosuppressive therapies. Moreover, this will be the first cardiac-derived, revascularized patch available for treating ischemic areas of the heart.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is the development of a revascularized cardiac patch to treat ischemic heart failure and congenital repair in a way that is superior to existing technologies.  While medical advancements have decreased the overall mortality rate for acute myocardial infarction patients, therapeutic options are lacking to address the underlying loss of myocardial tissue, resulting in a mortality rate greater than 33% at five years. Inhibiting the onset or delaying the severity of heart failure will have a significant effect on lowering this mortality rate and reducing the treatment cost of heart failure, which currently is estimated at over $37 billion annually. The use of this product will further enhance the medical and scientific understanding of the mechanisms by which damaged cardiac tissue may be restored/repaired and patient life may be extended following myocardial infarction.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop a novel computer vision based plant identification system for commercialization in agricultural weed control. This system will provide a cost competitive alternative to chemical herbicides, a global $20B market. Existing computer vision based approaches can segment a 'splotch' of green vegetation from a brown background but are unable to provide the selectivity and precision necessary for mechanized, automated weeding. This project's objective is to create software algorithms that match the capability of the human eye and brain to quickly and reliably classify plants into crops and weeds in real-time. The project team will build a computer vision algorithm based on a hierarchical classifier. This classifier will utilize a field customized support vector machine (SVM) that uses point-of-interest rather than shape-based methods, a novel approach to visual object identification. The result of this research will be the creation of an algorithm integrated into an automated weeding system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant, as the development of an alternative to chemical intensive agricultural weed control will impact technological understanding, create commercial opportunity, and positively impact society. Technologically, the project will advance the fields of computer vision and machine learning through development of a real-time, automated plant identification system based on point-of-interest and SVMs. Commercially, the system will offer conventional farmers an effective and chemical-free method to eliminate weeds, and it will offer organic farmers the first truly precise organic weed control method. The addressable market for weed control in food production is estimated to be $4B in the U.S. The system's ability to eliminate the use of chemical herbicides has a profound societal effect. U.S. farmers apply over 250M pounds of herbicide annually on corn and soybeans alone, with many unintended and detrimental side effects. Chemical concentrations in rivers, lakes and groundwater are rising, and the prevalence of herbicide resistant weeds is growing exponentially. An alternative to these chemicals limits society's exposure while protecting environmental integrity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a low-cost 10kW micro-turbine power generator that provides the basis for portability, fuel flexibility, and reduced maintenance of conventional turbo-machines at a cost that is competitive with reciprocating engines.  Current micro-turbines have prohibitively high costs due to complicated geometry and materials, but the proposed research will develop a micro-turbine with significantly lower manufacturing costs using a novel layered stackable architecture for the core micro-turbine engine.  The primary research objectives are 1) to optimize micro-turbine components within the framework of the new proposed geometry using a combination of in-house numerical analysis and computational fluid dynamics, 2) to design application-specific peripherals and user interface for power generation at oil and gas wells - the proposed entry market, and 3) to build and test a field-ready prototype to validate the engine design and benchmark engine performance.  The result of the proposed project is a compact, and low-maintenance 10kW micro-turbine power generator that will be produced for lower than $500 per kW.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is greatly increased commercial viability of micro-turbine power generators.  The primary advantages of micro-turbines are portability, fuel flexibility, and low maintenance.  Micro-turbines do not have significant market share due to prohibitively high upfront costs, but the proposed technology will bring costs down and enable micro-turbines to gain significant traction in many markets, including emergency response, oil and gas well power generation, and other remote/distributed power generation applications. Due to their portability, micro-turbine generators can be deployed quickly in emergency situations.  Due to their fuel flexibility, implementing micro-turbines can significantly reduce the costs associated with the fuel supply chain, for example, associated gases that would otherwise be flared at oil/gas wells can be used to power equipment onsite.  Due to their low maintenance, microturbines can be adopted where operating costs can be prohibitive for reciprocating engines.  Lastly, the proposed project will lead to reduced carbon footprint by efficiently using fuel that would be otherwise wasted (as in the case of flare gas), reduce other toxic emissions via more efficient combustion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will perfect a proprietary batch-scale processing technique for fabricating ultrahard and ultrasharp atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips.  The new process involves two steps.  First, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is used to coat the tips with a chemically inert, highly conductive, and extremely hard material. Second, a patented process that we have developed, field directed sputter sharpening (FDSS), sharpens the probe tip to atomic dimensions (1- 4 nm radius of curvature at the tip apex).  Hard, sharp tips are of considerable scientific and market interest because tip geometry and mechanical properties significantly impact the results of AFM measurements. The current project will carry out research to perfect a batch wafer-scale process able to manufacture hundreds of tips at once.  In order to bring the technique to market, the following research and development tasks will be carried out: (a) optimization of process conditions to reproducibly sharpen arrays of AFM probes fabricated on 4-inch wafers, (b) investigation of the ability to coat and sharpen AFM probes with a variety of hard film materials, and (c) assessment of the performance of batch-fabricated probe tips for market-driven probe microscopy applications.

    The broader/commercial impact of the project arises from the development of robust, reproducible, and durable tips that are more resistant to wear (due to the high hardness) and have favorable characteristics for AFM imaging (small radius of curvature, controlled aspect ratio, and electrically conductive). The project will benefit the academic and industrial communities who use scanning probe microscopy imaging. Although AFM and related probe microscopies have many advantages over electron microscopy (e.g., they can be used under ambient conditions and they can be easily interfaced with optical spectroscopy), one significant drawback is that the probe tips have limited lifetimes owing to wear during use. The development and commercial introduction of probe tips that are ultrasharp, very hard, conductive, and relatively inexpensive will significantly enhance the capabilities of AFM and related techniques such as scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM), a technique of great interest to the microelectronics industry because it is useful for the on-board testing of integrated circuits for delay faults. The research will also be of benefit to those who image insulating surfaces such as polymers and other soft materials where static charge build-up limits efficacy, and to those developing multi-tip probe arrays for lithographic and nanomanufacturing applications.

    This project will enable students to learn difficult science concepts using a collaborative gaming approach that aims to significantly increase student engagement and understanding. This game is being developed to improve the instruction of photosynthesis and cell respiration, which are required curriculum for high school students in life science courses. These processes are largely invisible, comprised of a complex and interdependent set of interactions, and difficult to teach. By creating educationally sound interactive tools to undertake complicated science subjects, the project aims to increase secondary student involvement and interest in STEM, and to help build the core scientific knowledge and higher-order thinking skills they will need to address the challenges of the 21st Century. The app content and design is based on evidence-based pedagogical approaches to effective science instruction. Developing a more immersive and practicable learning method upholds the NSF's mission to promote exceptional science education and will help attract and prepare more students for STEM-based careers. This work will provide teachers with an instructional tool that conveys accurate details of chemically-based biological processes, enable them to deliver differentiated instruction to their classes, and ensure that all their students, whatever their level of pre-existing knowledge and ability, are able to meet the prescribed national and state-level life science standards.

    The project proposes to develop and implement a working simulator that produces scientifically accurate output for a virtual lab learning environment, with which students can quickly build practical understanding of the scientific method through trial and error. This enables a) the introduction of legitimate agency into student learning so that their choices drive the learning, b) the generation of meaningful (non-generic) instructional prompts that respond precisely to how each individual interacts with the game, and c) the establishment of a valuable framework for assessing student learning based on their multiple authentic interactions with the simulator. The simulator will represent biological processes using a mathematical model in order to support an arbitrary range of hypotheses. Additional innovations include a) automated tools that differentiate instruction at the classroom level to help teachers address a range of student proficiencies, from remedial to advanced, b) expanded device-to-device student interactions that utilize collaborative assessments and argumentation games, c) app management tools that enable teachers to organize, monitor and assess individual student participation within these collaborative activities, and d) the integration of relevant geohistorical climate data into each player's "reward garden" in order to build aptitude and foster interest in quantitative analysis activities. Classroom testing will be conducted to validate our approach and demonstrate efficacy.

- abstractText: "This project creates an educational, touchscreen-based software that
    translates visual educational content into accessible, multisensory content for
    students with special needs, and particularly those with blindness and visual
    impairments. Consider the challenge in the educational landscape today: schools
    are increasingly adopting digital tools oriented toward creating a more interactive,
    personalized experience for mainstream students, but at the same time, are struggling
    to accommodate their diverse student population, particularly, the 6 million students
    in special education in the U.S. This problem is exaggerated in Science, Technology,
    Engineering, and Math (STEM), where content is often complex and visual. This
    project addresses these challenges, building on what we already know about human
    information processing and haptic interfaces to create software that will automatically
    convert highly visual content into content that can be seen, heard, and felt in
    real-time in class. This project supports NSF?s mission ensuring that inclusion
    of all students is at the forefront of the digital transformation of U.S. classrooms.
    The societal impacts of this work overcome several barriers impeding students
    with special needs from being independent and active contributors in the STEM
    educational experience and ultimately, many STEM professions. ViTAL projects a
    direct, financial return on investment for taxpayers within three years of operations,
    generating both revenue and new jobs, with plans to multiply this growth year
    over year. \n\n\nThe innovation in this project is the creation of methods and
    algorithms for effective translation of visual content into multimodal content,
    appropriately down sampled for the nonvisual sensory channels yet effective in
    conveying the most meaningful information. Such a conversion currently does not
    exist, which results in high overhead costs to create accessible graphics and
    is a major pain point in special education, particularly for individuals with
    visual impairments or blindness. Further, translating graphical content from the
    visual to the multimodal (visual, auditory, and haptic) space is not a straightforward
    conversion due to the limited bandwidth of human touch compared to vision and
    the complexity of features presented in graphical information. This challenge
    is exaggerated when accounting for the varying types of haptic feedback that can
    be provided from varying platforms (Android and iOS). This project addresses these
    challenges, creating a streamlined solution for generating accessible, multisensory
    content, in real-time, on commercial platforms for K-12 classrooms. The outcomes
    of this project will (1) create the algorithms needed to provide an automated
    conversion from the visual to multimodal space, (2) establish a teacher \"dashboard\"
    to streamline the proposed software?s integration in the classroom, and (3) expand
    the software to the iOS market while simultaneously uncovering novel haptic effects
    that leverage Apple?s unique Taptic feedback. Upon completion of the development,
    the software will be beta tested with partnering schools, and then released on
    both Android and iOS markets."

    This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.

    This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.

    This project will improve the awareness and perception of careers that require science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competencies. Advocacy is a critical component of career readiness, yet current advocates (parents, guardians, educators, or members of the community) are often not in the position to inform students of potential career options. Career and workforce readiness programs are resource constrained, don't meet the needs of differing learning styles, have inherent bias, and are largely focused on compliance over student competency building. Many underrepresented youths who would otherwise succeed in STEM are often deterred by a lack of role models. If youth understood the opportunities, they could pursue academic pathways to amass skills that better prepare them to enter the workforce. Furthermore, educators need professional learning experiences and access to insights about their students in order to improve STEM teaching and learning. Helping individuals select rewarding and suitable degrees, training, and careers will increase the likelihood of higher job retention. As more individuals are inspired to pursue and stay in STEM, taxpayers will benefit from increased innovation which in turn will provide tax dollars to invest in such things as healthcare, national security, education, or humanitarian assistance.

    The project will address technical challenges of amassing and distributing massive amounts of 3rd party STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) resource data (both structured and unstructured), developing an information management system for educators and families, developing adaptive learning skill modules, advancing a second generation smart recommendation engine based on big data, machine learning and predictive modeling techniques, and performing database mining and creating data visualizations to derive meaningful workforce development insights. In addition, the project will involve controlled experiments and usability tests whereby a large amount of anonymized and aggregated student data and business/education entity feedback will be collected. The ultimate goals of the R&D and experiments are to validate that the resulting application, predictive models, information management practices, advocacy networks, and data visualizations have the desired outcome of boosting immediate and near-term student outcomes regarding STEM career intentions and actions.

    This project will address the need for accessible, creative music education. Over 90% of Americans believe music education is valuable, but very few people ever learn enough to create their own music. Instrument lessons are a great way for some beginners to learn about music; however, instrument lessons are expensive and difficult, and focus on performance and technique at the expense of creativity. This project uses a simple audiovisual composition interface to empower music learners to create their own original music on mobile devices from the very beginning of their music education. By combining this intuitive composition interface with data tracking and analysis, this project creates the opportunity to provide music makers with personalized, adaptive feedback as they compose. Currently, $3 billion are spent each year in the United States on instrument lessons, even though they are unaffordable for many potential customers. By leveraging the proliferation of mobile devices worldwide, this project will deliver an accessible, low-cost digital music education option, creating a new market that includes customers who are currently priced out. Expanding participation in creative music education will increase the quantity and quality of music composed worldwide, while also building a sustainable, revenue-generating business and creating new jobs.

    Through data-driven agile software development, this project will address the need for accessible music education through the creation of a technology platform that delivers adaptive learning to musical beginners. Because the platform upon which this project is built is already empowering the creation of thousands of songs each week and collecting usage data from live users, this project is uniquely positioned to tackle the complex problem of providing algorithmic feedback on creative work at scale. Research and development will proceed in four stages: (1) expanding internal tools to allow for direct analysis of the thousands of songs being created on the platform each week; (2) developing an algorithmic approach to analyzing songs and reporting the results to users; (3) applying analysis to match users with relevant communities and collaborators; and (4) implementing adaptive learning approaches to help users more effectively learn to create music. This staged development process will result in an innovative and highly differentiated technology that enables beginners with no musical experience to compose their own music, and uses data to actively support their individual needs as they learn.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project aims to engineer microbes for the cost-effective production of specialty chemicals. Currently, engineered microbial strains bear mutations that increase the production of chemicals of interest by inhibiting the cell's ability to produce off pathway chemicals. These "loss-of-function" mutations are critical as they effectively channel the cell's metabolic flux toward the product of interest. This both boosts the production efficiency and eases downstream purification by eliminating the accumulation of undesirable but chemically-similar contaminants. Unfortunately, these mutations may also decrease the fitness of the cells and, as a result, the growth media must be supplemented with costly nutrients. Technical research herein will assess the feasibility of applying novel regulated proteolysis technology to simultaneously direct maximal metabolic flux toward the target chemical of interest while avoiding the need to supplement the growth media. If successful, this technology would provide a great cost savings and enable fermentative production to be applied more broadly in the production of specialty chemicals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a stable and cost-effective fermentative production route to a specialty chemical.  Fermentative production of chemicals offers many advantages over traditional petrochemical or extraction-based production processes.  Petrochemical production maintains the nation?s reliance on an unsustainable feedstock (oil) and also leads to national security issues as the US is largely dependent on foreign oil sources.  Chemical production via extraction from plant materials also has ecological challenges.  The process often uses toxic solvents, and may rely on unsustainable farming practices for many plants that are not traditional food crops.  Engineered microbes fermented on sugar feedstock produced using high-efficiency agricultural practices offer a stable alternative for producing specialty chemicals, both in terms of supply and price.

- abstractText: "This project extends the University of Central Florida's (UCF) I-Corps
    Site for an additional three years beyond their initial three-year award. NSF
    Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities
    whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their
    technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice,
    resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups
    to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.
    I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute
    to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
    investors. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are
    submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site.
    These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals
    are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site.
    These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years. \n\nThe
    intellectual merits of the I-Corps Site renewal project at UCF include the capture
    and curation of a deep understanding of (1) the processes, methodologies and programs
    for entrepreneurship education and technology commercialization, (2) Best practices
    for transitioning research from the bench top into the marketplace, (3) and distributing
    this knowledge to collaborators, partners, and affiliates throughout the NIN,
    and (4) development and adaptation of programs for specialty cohorts supporting
    local clusters and targeted populations. Additional knowledge and understanding
    will be gained through the collection of longitudinal data following I-Corps participants
    after they have completed the curriculum. \n\nUCF is an active and engaged partner
    in the Central Florida innovation ecosystem. The broader impacts from this project
    directly contribute to the broader community understanding of innovation-based
    economic development and the importance of research and commercialization. This
    is critically important to a community that is dependent on tourism and hospitality
    and the associated lower paying jobs in the region. Building on the initial successes
    of the UCF I-Corps Site program, successful commercialization of research and
    inventions generated at the leading research institutions and affiliate organizations
    in the region, this renewal project has the potential to significantly impact
    the regional economy. Further, with curriculum that effectively serves Hispanic
    populations, there is the potential to produce major social and economic impact
    on a national level. Florida has the third largest Hispanic population in the
    U.S., with nearly 25% of UCF student population and 34% of Florida business owners
    being of Hispanic origin, making this an ideal location to develop, deploy, and
    refine the curriculum."

    This project, from Binghamton University, creates an NSF I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The Binghamton I-Corps Site strengthens the ecosystem at Binghamton University. By integrating existing innovation support programs and technology transfer with entrepreneurship and business incubation services, technologies stemming from faculty research, student ingenuity, and community innovators are evaluated for commercial viability. Experienced technology transfer professionals, technical experts resident in Binghamton's industry-facing centers, and on-staff entrepreneurship and financial advisers recruit teams and promote promising teams into the program.

    Entrepreneurship and engineering faculty, entrepreneurs-in-residence (EIRs), and community coaches and mentors stimulate ideation and team building, and guide the innovators through theory and practice, and, ultimately, the go / no-go decision. By virtue of a rigorous selection process and hands-on training, the teams with customer-validated, technology- and manufacturing-feasible products and services proceed with commercialization with further support from the university, local businesses, and funders, as well as the I-Corps regional and national nodes. The process creates a growing cadre of entrepreneurs who continue to innovate, build businesses, mentor and invest in others, and overall recharge the entrepreneurial ecosystem, making Binghamton and the University a hub for entrepreneurs, investors, and start-up companies.

    The Binghamton I-Corps Site is meant to transform the mindset of University faculty, staff and students, as well as that of community members and leaders by providing a practical, achievable approach to generating new, sustainable ventures built around technologies. Demonstrating this path forward creates positive and powerful relationships between universities, the local business, professional services and investor communities, industry, and government. Generating trust and interactions between academia-private sector-government has ripple effects far beyond the teams going through the program, and propagate a self-sustaining, entrepreneurial ecosystem driven and replenished by new launches. Furthermore, by bringing together entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs, this Site program blurs lines separating big and small business, manufacturing and service industries, academia and the private sector, and spurs efforts towards the common goal of value and job creation through new ventures. Successful launches of companies inspire Binghamton University researchers, students and graduates, and instill optimism about the prospects for creating wealth and fulfilling jobs in Binghamton, or wherever their careers take them throughout the nation.

    innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network
    of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe Lobo Rainforest I-Corps
    Site is a partnership between UNM's two innovation and entrepreneurial units,
    the Innovation Academy (iA) and STC.UNM (STC). The iA provides students with direct
    experience and real-world skills in entrepreneurship, equipping them with the
    requisite proficiency to transition their original ideas into the marketplace.
    iA offers a suite of courses, a scholars project-based program, a minor in innovation,
    and an entrepreneurial literacy program. STC works with entrepreneurial faculty
    and students at UNM to explore new inventions, commercialize technologies, protect
    intellectual property and create start-up companies based on UNM research innovations.
    iA, STC and their programs and services co-locate at the Lobo Rainforest Building,
    a new structure with spaces to accelerate commercialization of intellectual capital
    and generate successful startup companies. NSF I-Corps Site funding leverages
    these innovation and technology transfer services, physical facilities, expert
    staff, and business, industry, and community connections and networks to support
    117 new student and faculty teams over a five-year period. Teams collaborate with
    two I-Corps Nodes in the Southwest corridor, further building on local and regional
    ecosystems for innovation, and connecting with the National Innovation Network.\n\nNew
    Mexico is a majority-minority state, and UNM is a Hispanic Serving Institution
    with a strong track record of supporting commercialization of faculty-originated
    technology, including 139 women inventors. The iA is comprised of over 50% women,
    over 50% minorities, and over 65% first generation college students. UNM's demographic
    is unique for a Carnegie R1 doctoral university (61% minority, 41% Hispanic, 56%
    female), making it an excellent environment for recruiting and broadening participation
    of women and minorities in entrepreneurial activities. UNM is also implementing
    an NSF ADVANCE grant, focused on increasing the participation of women faculty,
    particularly minority women, in STEM leadership positions, complementing the Lobo
    Rainforest I-Corps Site program. The UNM I-Corps Site will focus on those mechanisms
    most useful in expanding entrepreneurial opportunities for women and other underrepresented
    groups."

Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The University of Arkansas I-Corps Site, STEP (STEAM Training in Entrepreneurial Practices), builds on university activities and programs that accelerate the commercialization of research by faculty and students. In addition, several UA Research Centers and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites will involve affiliated faculty and students in STEP, a 10-week summer program that is divided into two phases. Phase I, with 15 teams, will focus on instruction in lean startup principles and initial customer discovery interviews. Phase II, with eight teams that receive additional funding, will further develop the most promising business ideas from Phase I. The STEP site will include undergraduate and graduate student teams and faculty from three UA System campuses: the University of Arkansas (UA), the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), and the University of Arkansas Little Rock (UALR).

    Although the state of Arkansas has made progress in the development of high-growth businesses based on university research outcomes over the past decade, Arkansas continues to be one of the most economically challenged states in the country. The STEP Site encourages researchers to expand their horizons beyond the research they are doing in their labs and consider how the commercialization of their inventions might help promote economic development in the state. In addition to the broader impact of economic development, the STEP Site enables the university to continue its efforts to improve entrepreneurial education for females and underrepresented populations. The university's successful programs for underrepresented high school through graduate students provide a base upon which to build these efforts.

    This project, from Penn State University, creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The Penn State I-Corps Site, operated under the umbrella of the Invent Penn State Initiative and the Office of Entrepreneurship and Commercialization, supports the translation of university research, develops partnerships between the university and regional economic development organizations and the national I-Corps Network, and trains students to be the drivers of research commercialization.

    The Penn State I-Corps Site teams that pursue commercialization through two different programs, the TechCelerator@State College and the Happy Valley LaunchBox. These two programs are structured to nurture innovator teams using Lean Startup methodology and embody the notion of nurturing innovators both with deep craft and fresh eyes, that is, people with some who have depth of technical expertise as well as those with a fresh perspective on new markets, communication technologies, and consumer concepts. The TechCelerator Program, established in 2011 seeks to accelerate the commercialization of University technology. The Happy Valley Launchbox, created in 2015, is a community-university accelerator that makes extensive use of Lean Startup principles and Design Thinking to help teams bring their ideas into the marketplace. The I-Corps Site program provides funds to teams that are either selected out of one of these programs or have members combined from both programs to support the translation of university technology. The I-Corps Site also engages the broad network of Penn State Innovation hubs across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

    The outcomes of this project have the potential for significant broader impacts across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the region. Initial activity focuses on Penn State's main University Park Campus. However, Invent Penn State operates 13 community innovation hubs throughout the State, affiliated with the University's network of Commonwealth campuses. In addition, the Penn State I-Corps Site, in collaboration with the Upstate New York regional I-Corps Node will run summer programs to train leaders from the commonwealth innovation hubs in Lean startup methodology and will engage their promising teams with the Upstate New York (UNY) regional I-Corps Node.

The institution plays a significant role in providing pathways to commercialization for scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics related research and new startup endeavors. In 2016, Vanderbilt opened its Wond'ry, a new innovation center that serves its entire community of faculty, students, and staff across all academic disciplines. The Wond?ry provides a facility to host and implement the NSF I-Corps Sites program. Since its opening, the Wond'ry inspired innovation and entrepreneurial interest on campus. Combined with the I-Corps Site it becomes the primary pipeline to commercialization for many aspiring innovators and entrepreneurs. Implementing the I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt makes a positive difference by advancing on-campus activities related to scouting, recruiting, educating supporting and contributing to the National Innovation Network. The two primary outcomes of the I-Corps at Vanderbilt Program are growing a talented diverse and globally competitive workforce of STEM and Life Scientists that are trained to think entrepreneurially about discovery, and nuturing and supporting multiple, local teams to transition their new innovations and research into the marketplace.

    The I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt University goals are twofold: 1) to effectively integrate educational opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students on innovation and entrepreneurship within the traditional STEM and Life science curriculum, and 2) to motivate scientists to engage further in customer discovery as part of their scientific agenda, in the hopes that they will devote their science to addressing and solving problems and real needs in society. The Site at Vanderbilt helps overcome commercialization challenges by incorporating a for-credit course built heavily on the I-Corps curriculum and through the hosting of workshops that provide an introduction to customer discovery and business canvas development. By providing a proven model of success and more cohesive structure, the program ensures that faculty, staff, and students receive the best possible training and are introduced to a vast array of regional and national entrepreneurial resources.

    The I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt trains participants to 1) create solutions to problems with significant positive impact on communities, 2) focus on research with major economic development opportunities, and 3) develop into globally competitive as STEM entrepreneurs. Society will ultimately benefit via an improvement in quality of life through the solutions created to address real-world issues. Middle Tennessee will benefit by having a cohort of well-trained entrepreneurs who, by completing the I-Corps program, will better understand how to identify a viable commercial opportunity and subsequently oversee its successful operational implementation and launch. This will speed the translation of research into new technologies. The subsequent positive economic impacts will occur via these increases in commercialization activities and the number of useful intellectual property disclosures. Subsequent agreements with commercial partners will then grow the region's entrepreneurial ecosystem and empower STEM-entrepreneurs in larger numbers than ever before, thus increasing self confidence in undertaking entrepreneurial endeavors and thus contributing positively to our nation's overall economic growth and vibrancy.

    NSF I-Corps Site at this institution.\n\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites
    are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture
    and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into
    the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities,
    training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the
    marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen
    innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network
    of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe objective of USC's
    I-Corps Site is to establish a sustainable innovation ecosystem with strong links
    to the local entrepreneurial community. This Site nurtures science, technology,
    engineering and mathematics (STEM) faculty and students who are engaged in projects
    with potential to be transitioned into the marketplace using an integrated entrepreneurship
    curricula, business mentorship, and assignment of resources to early stage discoveries.
    \n\nThe USC I-Corps Site increases awareness and piques the interest of students
    and faculty in technology, expands the engagement of seasoned entrepreneurs and
    investors with researchers, and advances the translation of discoveries to commercial
    applications. The program encompasses three major tasks: (1) enhances entrepreneurial
    training based on the Lean LaunchPad methodology, (2) expands USC's current engagement
    with seasoned entrepreneurs and investors to foster mentoring of junior entrepreneurs.
    This is accomplished through a three-tier strategy that entails one-on-one mentoring,
    an Expert-in-Residence program, student internships in start-ups, and (3) fosters
    outreach activities by disseminating the program curricular activities and best
    practices, and directing strategies to enhance participation of underrepresented
    groups. \n\nThe USC Site program addresses critical barriers to the growth of
    academic entrepreneurship by providing an experiential learning framework with
    an emphasis on customer discovery, networking, and strategic partnerships. The
    tangible outcomes include new opportunities for research funding, strengthened
    academia-industrial connections, and unique exposure of students to real world
    translational research. A secondary outcome of this program is the evolution of
    academic culture that values entrepreneurship and is more proactive in taking
    risk and finding resources to bring ideas to reality. This transition in academic
    culture enhances USC?s efforts to attract students in STEM fields and strengthens
    its role in economic development and job creation.\n\nThe outreach portion of
    this Site is geared toward improving diversity inclusion and enhancing participation
    of underrepresented groups through a wider dissemination of educational activities.
    The broader impacts are four-fold. First, the educational framework offers an
    immersive experience that prepares students to identify and pursue high impact
    opportunities regardless of their vocation. Second, it fosters the innovation
    ecosystem by promoting collaborations between faculty and business partners. This
    stimulates the commercial translation of fundamental research, and exposes the
    local business community to USC's research capacity. Third, it puts in place a
    robust framework for I-Corps team formation to enhance the chance of success of
    USC entrepreneurs in competing for SBIR/STTR and follow-on funding. Fourth, the
    program facilitates the development of a unique model for an entrepreneurial ecosystem
    that combines the best practices from Silicon Valley with the distinct resources
    and assets available in the Southeast."

    This project, from the University at Buffalo (IB), creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    Through their I-Corps Site, UB improves the way technology is commercialized and entrepreneurship is cultivated. UB receives over eighty invention disclosures annually that result in patents, licenses, and the formation of startup companies. To train participant entrepreneurial teams, UB's Business & Entrepreneur Partnerships in the Office of Economic Development (BEP) offers a unique two-phase, resource-efficient training process in the areas of: Customer Discovery, Lean Startup methods, The Business Model Canvas, Developing a prioritized list of testable hypotheses and open questions, and Assessing the strength of an opportunity. Under Phase I, teams receive workshop instruction, work closely with mentors and practice customer discovery. Phase II training integrates intensive customer engagement. UB views the NSF I-Corps Site program as an important way to: 1) perform more robust technical and commercial assessments of new technologies; 2) increase inventors' entrepreneurial skills leading to system-wide culture change; 3) improve the quality of future research proposals; 4) increase commercialization success; 5) prepare inventors and students for success in the I-Corps Node program; 6) pursue SBIR/STTR funding; and 6) provide graduate students and postdocs with a world class experience that will impact their entire careers.

    The UB I-Corps Site program broader impacts are realized through the creation of a network of strategic partnerships between researchers and engaged commercial interests. These relationships increase: industry-sponsored research funding; competitive SBIR/STTR applications; pivotal student experiences; campus-wide, interdisciplinary collaborations; the level of industry mentorship; the number and quality of invention disclosures; participation of 5-10 teams (annually) in the I-Corps Node Program; and overall culture change (innovative, entrepreneurial, collaborative, multidisciplinary). UB's Technology Transfer Office is joined by a number of other units and strategic partners - an inclusivity that extends the impact of the I-Corps Site award across the campus, into the business community, and supports a greater public mission.

    This project, from the University of Utah, creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This is a Type II proposal, requesting a "renewal" of funding for an existing I-Corps Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.

    The University of Utah I-Corps Site program encourages and assists students and faculty in transitioning research projects to commercialization by providing education, training, resources and networking required for understanding markets, customers, product-market fit and to answer business and/or technology questions. The I-Corps Site program at the University of Utah is currently in its 3rd year and has trained nearly 90 teams and over 150 participants. The program resulted in successful business and technology go/no-go decisions, successful transition to commercialization, and helped advance five technologies to the commercial start-up stage. This extension focuses on refining the curriculum by implementing lessons learned in the first three years of the program, developing new teams and generating more successful transitions, as well as implementing the new financing model that will assure future program sustainability without further government funding.

    The Utah I-Corps Site enhances and builds upon this institution's existing expertise in medical device innovation, commercialization and entrepreneurship. This Site initiated the development of a model of transitioning from research-based technologies to viable commercial products in academic environment that allows the university to expand their innovation programs, provide more impactful resources to faculty and student innovation teams and improve recruitment of underrepresented participants. This extension further generalizes and disseminates the developed curriculum and implements agreements and procedures to assure its future financial sustainability. Partnership networks within the university support underrepresented student and faculty groups and offer the support and resources needed to help such groups thrive and participate in the process and, as the program becomes self-sustaining, will be extended, through internships and special courses to other colleges and local high schools. Thus, the program helps increase the diversity of the regional business environment leading to enhanced growth and economic prosperity for all citizens in the region.

    accelerate the commercialization of student, faculty and regional innovations
    into the marketplace, foster and facilitate the exchange of ideas between the
    university and industry and prepare students to become entrepreneurs. This I-Corps
    Sites project: \n1. Supports and expands an entrepreneurial culture in a region
    where entrepreneurs historically have not had significant assistance; \n2. Expands
    opportunities for undergraduate and graduate business and STEM students so that
    they are able obtain hands-on experience in the implementation of product validation
    activities and to engage in real-world STEM-related business projects; \n3. Assists
    STEM faculty to become more comfortable with the practice of marketing their inventions
    by introducing them to the I-Corps theory and practice of the I-Corps methodology;
    \n4. Integrates the I-Corps methodology throughout the UTRGV infrastructure so
    that the university will be able to carry out its mission of \"transforming Texas
    and the nation through the commercialization of university discoveries\".\n\nThere
    are several advantages to having an I-Corps site at UTRGV: being located directly
    on the U-S.-Mexican border, the UTRGV I-Corps is unique in that it the site is
    both binational and bicultural; and, the region that UTRGV serves is one of the
    fastest growing yet impoverished areas in the country. Promoting support for entrepreneurship
    in such a region demonstrates how well the I-Corps methodology works in a historically
    underserved area of the country.\n\nThis project advances the commercialization
    of ideas that come from the STEM colleges and departments within UTRGV by providing
    STEM faculty and students with a methodology to promote their products and ideas
    in the marketplace. It also broadens the participation of normally underrepresented
    Hispanic students in the commercialization process. Ultimately, it will benefit
    the regional economy of deep-south Texas by providing support for start-up businesses
    and it will enhance the research enterprise at UTRGV through the creation of interdisciplinary
    teams."

    locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors,
    researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nRutgers University has funded research
    of over $600M per year. This research generates over 150 patents each year and
    more than $15M in licensing income annually. A challenge is to transition research
    outcomes to the commercialization stage. The Rutgers University I-Corps Site cultivates
    this pool of early stage ideas and assists with bringing viable concepts through
    the commercialization pathway to the marketplace. Through the I-Corps Site, with
    targeted training and mentoring, I-Corps teams are sourced from the Rutgers Site
    partners. These include the Office of Research Commercialization, educational
    activities ranging from the Collaboration for Technology Entrepreneurship and
    Commercialization (CTEC) and Professional Science Master's (PSM) programs, senior-year
    \"capstone\" engineering design and Honors College programs, and many other feeder
    programs. Mentors are matched to these teams. Inventors benefit from the larger
    innovation ecosystem in the New Jersey/New York region, as the Site partners with
    the NYCRIN I-Corps Node. \n\nThe Rutgers I-Corps Site provides training, mentoring,
    and access to a large network of business, technical and financial resources.
    The signature activity of this program is that each year, 30 teams participate
    and test the commercial potential of their products with a broad base of consumers.
    This program promotes the value of commercialization to both faculty and students,
    and reinforces the concept that ideas generated by the academic research process
    can have societal and commercial value.\n\nThe Rutgers I-Corps bridges the gap
    between the lab and the marketplace, enhancing the University's commitment to
    fostering economic development across New Jersey and beyond. As the number of
    spin-outs from the university increases, jobs are created and companies hire students
    as interns and graduates as full-time employees. The program's impact goes beyond
    the University by tapping into local business leaders and entrepreneurs for team
    mentorship as well as expanding programs to support the communities around Rutgers
    campuses and to particularly assist underrepresented inventors and business-owners.
    A key area of focus is to increase I-Corps participation from women in STEM and
    ultimately to increase the number of women-owned businesses in the region/state."

    by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted
    by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.\n\nThis Site will continue
    to support MIT researchers that are working on new, innovative and differentiating
    technologies. To date, over seventy teams have participated in the MIT I-Corps
    Site training programs and the total will be well over 100 by the end of the initial
    award. Ten teams have completed the NSF National Team Program and two more have
    been accepted. Collectively, the graduates have received over $8 million in additional
    grants or awards to continue developing their technologies. Six companies have
    submitted SBIR or STTR proposals and four have been awarded so far. Two companies
    were accepted into accelerator programs. The startups have raised over $6.5 million
    in early stage investment and at least twenty-five new jobs have been created.
    Three of the companies have successfully reached commercialization of their publicly
    funded new technologies. Additional outcomes show that participants learn new
    skills both professionally as well as in entrepreneurship. The training contributes
    to their current research and has affected how they will conduct their future
    research by including commercialization potential as part of their planning. Site
    participants benefit from a Team Mentoring approach through a partnership with
    the MIT Venture Mentoring Service that continues beyond their I-Corps training.
    The mentor team framework increases rates of learning and provides continuity
    in nurturing the teams as they advance their ideas.\n\nMIT's activities are likely
    to have broad impact including: encouraging entrepreneurial aspirations and providing
    researchers with training and activities to understand the entrepreneurial process
    allowing them to greatly increase their future prospects while still within the
    academic environment; attracting and supporting a greater number of students,
    faculty and other researchers to actively explore the possibilities of translating
    their research into future commercial applications, ensuring the supply needed
    to fuel the continuous flow of innovations needed by society; and, encouraging
    more women and other underrepresented participants to become engaged and reach
    successful outcomes, serving as visible role models to accelerate the participation
    of others. Finally, through its existing and active Outreach Program, MIT VMS
    will disseminate both the knowledge and practical techniques to its large and

    well as that of the larger Boston innovation ecosystem. The foundation for the
    program is a growing body of funded research which offers untapped opportunities
    for commercialization. To facilitate entrepreneurship, Northeastern created a
    series of entrepreneurship courses for undergraduate and graduate students, as
    well as an on-campus incubator feeding ventures into the local investment community.\n\nThe
    Northeastern I-Corps Site program substantially increases both the quantity and
    quality of STEM-related ventures founded through its Site. The I-Corps Site program
    also leverage Northeastern's technology licensing office as well as its Mentor
    and Investors Networks in support of Site teams. There are 280 active individual
    Mentors supporting Northeastern's startups, as well as a variety of angel and
    venture capital investors who regularly assess Northeastern ventures, fifty of
    which have garnered $70 million in venture finance over the past three years.
    \n\nNortheastern University's entrepreneurship system is based on the meta-process
    of Educate, Incubate, and Launch. The I-Corp Site program is a highly focused
    way to a) better recruit a specific graduate, postdoc, and faculty population
    of potential technological entrepreneurs, and b) provide initial entrepreneurship
    and innovation education and training for them. Northeastern is also conducting
    research to more clearly understand the effect of entrepreneurial learning for
    first time entrepreneurs in its own incubator, focusing on the specific areas
    of developing customer insight, new product and service solutions, and business
    models. Several I-Corp ventures are already part of this study.\n\nNortheastern's
    Site goals are to increase the number and quality of technology ventures emerging
    from laboratories and to feed new ventures into the I-Corps National program.
    Another important impact is that I-Corps offers a complementary pathway for early
    stage ventures to pursue initial funding through I-Corps Node and SBIR/STTR programs.
    Another potential impact is the expansion of this program in subsequent years
    to early stage entrepreneurs working in the numerous research environments within
    one mile of the Northeastern campus. These institutions include the medical schools
    and hospitals affiliated with Harvard, Tufts, and Boston University, as well as
    organizations pursuing research in robotics, cybersecurity, and IoT among other

    This project, from New York University (NYU), creates an I-Corps Site at this institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    NYU Tandon School of Engineering (NYU-SoE) Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) will "encourage and support diversity in STEM entrepreneurship, among women in particular, by encouraging social entrepreneurship, an approach that has shown to be attractive to women." Using the Lean LaunchPad approach infused with insights into supporting diversity, teams will receive funding for customer discovery, prototyping, and other resources to support commercialization across multiple academic terms. This approach is supported by a strong network of faculty and mentors who have exhibited an excellent record of previous NSF funding and commercialization successes.

    The intellectual merit of this proposal incorporates the proposition that social entrepreneurship is more attractive to underrepresented groups, particularly women. By pursuing avenues that will increase diversity in both STEM and entrepreneurship, through the training, programs, and mentorship of the site, this project may serve as an exemplar for I-Corps nationally.

    This is a proposal from the University of California - Irvine (UC-Irvine) to create an I-Corps Site. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This project, at UC-Irvine, integrates units across campus, focuses on minorities and is likely to have an impact both on the campus and on the regional ecosystem. The Site is built on an already existing 31K sq. ft. collaborative facility, providing a rich environment for commercialization. The I-Corps Site focuses on research strengths such as photonics, nanotechnology, bioengineering, chemistry, medical and life sciences, and transportation. The institution has a large percentage of low-income students, and ranks first among UC institutions for Latino freshman applications, and second in African-American freshman applications. They have a good plan for accessing these students, as well as STEM students. In addition, the Center has helped create businesses with socially conscious missions.

    This project, from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) creates an extension and expansion of their current I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This Site is the outcome of a Type II proposal from UCSD. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals: Type I - Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site; Type II - Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. The UCSD Type II project proposed continuation and expansion of USCD's existing I-Corps Site, expanding target teams from 30 to 50 annually, integrating collaboration with the existing StartupXX program to nurture female entrepreneurs, adding leadership and team dynamics workshops in collaboration with an existing center on campus, and extending mentoring for I-Corps teams by six months. The Site also builds on a solid track record of success from first round I-Corps Site funding. The extensions to the existing Site are well-conceived, with clearly defined goals, and push the envelope of programming with the requested new funding. Their Site effectively leverages and integrates complementary existing programs, across disciplines, in a strong campus and regional ecosystem.

    This project, from the University of Toledo, will extend and expand their current Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site. I-Corps Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The University of Toledo is repositioning their site program into one that will directly support commercialization of faculty-led research. This is a shift away from the focus of their prior site grant, which supported interdisciplinary, undergraduate-student entrepreneurship. The goal of their new site program is to send teams to the national I-Corps program and prepare them for applying for SBIR and other external funding. They will hold four short courses each year, for 30+ teams. The Site and their personnel have been active nationally, are producing successful teams, are sending teams to the National program, and are launching companies. They have built a Mentor pool to support their teams. They have strong comprehension of the I-Corps program and close collaboration with their regional I-Corps Node. The existence of a Site in Toledo has already had an impact on the region's ecosystem and also at the state level. Leveraging the two I-Corps Sites in Ohio (at Toledo and Akron), the state of Ohio legislated I-Corps@Ohio to expand the support commercialization. The Toledo Site also collaborates with the Rocket Venture Fund and other incubator facilities.

    This project, from the City University of New York (CUNY) creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.  Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This particular Site plan is unusual in that it involves spreading the I-Corps program to the Community College (CC) population, as well as to other affiliated institutions. CUNY has a large CC component overall in its student population. Its approach to serving the CC population is creative and potentially adoptable and is likely to impact a large population. Not only will teams be recruited along traditional channels and through community colleges, eight CUNY campuses currently participate in a coordinated undergraduate research program, a source of additional undergraduate teams.

    The institution (as well as its affiliates) are extremely diverse. For example, 60% of the student population is female. A large portion is economically challenged. Other typically underrepresented cohorts in STEM (Hispanics, racial minorities, etc.) also make up a large portion of the student population. Consequently, the expectation is that entrepreneurial culture changes are likely to be profound for this population. Overall, this Site could serve as a national model for inclusion.

    This proposal from the University of Virginia (UVA) creates and I-Corps Site at this institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The UVA I-Corps Site is a natural extension of the entrepreneurship efforts already in place on the campus. UVA has an extensive set of offerings for its students to learn about the basics of entrepreneurship. The University also has resources for proof of concept that fund teams building prototypes and testing product market fit. The UVA Site will provide the opportunity for early-stage support to help nascent teams take the first step toward commercialization. The Site will help fill the gap between a potentially marketable idea developed in one of the academic centers on campus and several existing translational funds that can provide more meaningful support for a promising start-up team, such as the Coulter Translational Research Partnership, the Biomedical Innovation Fund, the LaunchPad for Diabetes, and the LVG Seed Fund. The fit of the I-Corps program into the existing ecosystem makes UVA a very strong candidate for an I-Corps site. The project will have predictable broader impacts through its effect on the local and regional ecosystems - enabling the launch of new ventures to create jobs and improve the economy.

    This is a proposal to create an I-Corps Site at the University of California - Santa Cruz (UC-SC). The proposal outlines a focused summer program of eight weeks targeted at the under-represented population of the university. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    Particular strengths of the proposal include: offering the I-Corps curriculum during a summer program that is well articulated; targeting under-served students in a region with potential for significant impact; an unusual mix of social, not-for-profit startups with for-profit ones; a strong collaboration with the Bay Area I-Corps Node; the commitment from the university to support the I-Corps focused activities; and, there is likely to be an impact not only on the region but also on the students, 25% of who are Hispanic. This project could potentially serve as a model for others to replicate.

    This project, from Mississippi State University, establishes an I-Corps Site in the institution's Center for Entrepreneurship and Outreach (CEO).  NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. The Mississippi State CEO coordinates the efforts of the Office of Technology Management (OTM) and the E-Center to administer the I-Corps Site project. The goal is to recruit and manage thirty teams a year, with the objective of creating viable businesses based on university research.

    Mississippi State has combined their entrepreneurship center with outreach under an EDA University Center - creating the potential for better than average connections with regional businesses and recruiting representatives of those businesses to participate in the I-Corps Site activities. MS has already solidified some company connections and recruited an advisory board.

    There are clear goals for the Site and Mississippi State University has already started to translate research into businesses. Their existing entrepreneurship program is in line with I-Corps and this grant will help them scale-up those efforts. They have experience collaborating with the Southwest I-Corps Node and plans to continue that collaboration. They have a way to support teams that develop new ideas as well as an I-Corps-centric curriculum in place. They have a robust tracking/assessment plan for the program and the individual teams, an asset to the proposal and will help them to measure the impact of the program.

    The site has the potential to have high in on economically distressed and minority populations.  30% of this institution's entering freshman class and 16% of their faculty belong to minority groups.  In addition there is a program that provides support for veterans starting a business. This is a well-structured and thought out project that contains all of the elements that are needed to support a successful I-Corps Site.  It is clear from data they have provided that a Site at this institution would have a significant impact on the university and the region as well as the faculty and students at this institution.

    This project establishes an I-Corps Site at Cornell University. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.  The Cornell I-Corps Site represents a signature project of the institution's new Center for Technology Translation (CTT). The CTT serves as a central hub for entrepreneurship, innovation, product design, and prototyping education, all based on the Lean Launch Pad method. The Cornell Site integrates activities from the College of Business, College of Engineering, and Center for Technology Licensing, ultimately leading to synergistic benefits to an already thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem.

    There are several strengths that characterize Cornell's I-Corps Site: it connects to the upper New York state business incubator ecosystem, and adds new components; they seek to include women, the disabled and under-represented groups in their teams and have a solid plan to do so; existing connections to regional businesses are strong; Cornell's Site has substantial campus financial support and experienced leadership; innovation and entrepreneurship programs are well organized and integrated with each other; and, the existence of an I-Corps Site at Cornell is likely to impact the regional commercialization ecosystem.

    This project is a renewal of the Bay Area Regional I-Corps Node to continue creating a robust and broad-based entrepreneurship infrastructure built on the scientific, technology, and engineering strengths as well as the business thought leadership of three globally recognized universities, the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Stanford University. This I-Corps Node will continue building on its success of applying and disseminating the Lean Launchpad methodology through classes and training for both new trainers and early-stage startups. These startups will drive creation of sustainable, scalable science and technology-based startups with both regional and national impacts. The I-Corps Node also will raise awareness of the value of entrepreneurship among science and engineering faculty and students, using specialized programs to drive forcing mechanisms for collaboration. The success of the I-Corps Node itself will be the subject of continual evaluation and analysis, consistent with Lean LaunchPad principles, to develop and disseminate best practices for this region and the nation. A central focus of the Node's work will be finding more efficient ways of solving the two-sided market of connecting scientific and technical talent with business talent. A key question that will be elucidated by this I-Corps Node's research is whether structured mechanisms or a more organic approach will achieve the most favorable outcomes.

    The partner schools have been key contributors to the National Innovation Network in the development of new curriculum and advanced tools. The Node will continue to disseminate the Lean LaunchPad classes widely throughout the Node via classes like Hacking For Defense at Stanford. The Node will also create specialized programs for government funded research centers within universities and governmental agencies ,such as NSA, with the ultimate goal of financial sustainability. The training products and programs created by the I-Corps Node will have broad impact through their widespread dissemination throughout the Node network and beyond. All activities and programs at the I-Corps Node will facilitate the inclusion of groups from diverse regions, economic backgrounds, and ethnicities.

    This project by the University of Michigan I-Corps Node, one of the founding NSF I-Corps nodes, will expand the founding Node into a comprehensive regional node called I-Corps Midwest. I-Corps Midwest Node brings together the University of Michigan (UM) as the lead institution, and the University of Illinois Urbana Champagne, and Purdue University as partner institutions. This Node is uniquely suited to serve the Midwest entrepreneurial ecosystem by bridging rural communication gaps that typically lead to an uninformed commercial opportunity around research inventions, difficulty in retaining and accessing talent with sufficient breadth of specific and relevant expertise, and instilling customer discovery memory across I-Corps programs allowing entrepreneurial researchers to leverage learning from previous I-Corps teams.

    This project will create mechanisms to overcome the consequences of low ecosystem density by building on the existing partner university collaborations and create an active and cohesive network that leverages their collective commercialization pipeline, previous experiences, and connections. The Node will form a deeper understanding of the individual motivations and experiences of the faculty and students as they participate in I-Corps programs. This knowledge will help to continue driving culture change at these institutions and create the innovation human capital needed to move research ideas forward into the marketplace. The Node will create measurements of network activity and the resulting outcomes will provide information on which methodologies are effective and should be propagated to other regional clusters and the nation. This project builds on the previous four years of work by NSF to create collaborations that are critically important for institutions that are not located in entrepreneurially dense areas to reach and prepare individuals to compete on a national and international level.

    node called I-Corps South. I-Corps South Node brings together the Georgia Institute
    of Technology (GT) as the lead institution, and the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa,
    the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the University of Tennessee Knoxville
    as partner institutions. I-Corps South will introduce the labs, colleges, and
    universities throughout the Southeast to the entrepreneurial education, ultimately
    increasing commercialization outcomes in each of the participating states. The
    I-Corps South Node will reach more than half a million graduate and undergraduate
    students, and many thousands of the nation's research faculty.\n\nThis project
    provides I-Corps training and infrastructure to share the model I-Corps curriculum
    with regional affiliates. The primary institutions of I-Corps South will leverage
    their extensive industry relationships, partnerships, mentors, and funding connections
    to bring economic development through startup formation, workforce development,
    and entrepreneurial education. The Node will serve its region's research universities
    and HBCUs via a robust affiliates program. The I-Corps South Node's research contribution
    will lead to an understanding of how NSF-funded teams can be better supported
    to commercialize inventions, and uncover why some academics choose to become entrepreneurs,
    while others do not participate in commercialization activities. I-Corps South
    is also creating a pilot program to create an intelligent support system for I-Corps
    instructors, built upon IBM's Watson. \n\nThis project's planned activities will
    expand the I-Corps curriculum repertoire for effective entrepreneurship training,
    creating a long-lasting impact on the region's teams and entrepreneurs. Its geographically
    dispersed collaborative network of Sites and affiliates will accelerate the development
    of the South's entrepreneurial ecosystems, and provide for increased partnership
    opportunities between academia and industry. The recruitment of new national I-Corps
    teams will increase the impact of the federally funded research. Finally, its
    focus on underrepresented minorities through programs at HBCUs and in Puerto Rico
    will increase the participation of those individuals in entrepreneurship, improving
    their well-being and inspiring future generations to pursue research and job creation
    activities, a clear and substantial benefit to society."

    Customer Discovery process. Aggie I-Corps provides teams with training, resources,
    networking opportunities, and seed funding to move their ventures towards the
    market, along with a range of follow-on funding through local competitions, NSF
    I-Corps, SBIR/STTR, and private investors. Aggie I-Corps is offered three times

    a competitive application process intended to identify innovations across campus
    in areas typically funded by the NSF.\n\nA novel aspect of the Aggie I-Corps program
    is the focus on Value Proposition Design as opposed to Business Model Design,
    which is the subject of most I-Corps and Lean LaunchPad programs. The purpose
    for the shift to Value Proposition Design is to focus on the two most challenging
    segments of Business Model Canvas: Customer Segments and Value Propositions. The
    core hypothesis is that dedicated training using Value Proposition Canvas will
    serve as a better introduction to entrepreneurship and the Lean LaunchPad methodology
    than starting with the full Business Model Canvas. If successful, the Aggie I-Corps
    could serve as a model for introductory entrepreneurship programs and future I-Corps
    Sites preparing teams for the National I-Corps program.\n\nNMSU and Arrowhead
    have been growing a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship on campus, particularly
    through their Studio G, NMSU/Arrowhead's student business accelerator. In the
    past two years, 80 new member startups were added, involving over 150 student
    entrepreneurs. This rapid growth signifies a large demand for entrepreneurship
    training at NMSU. Aggie I-Corps is an opportunity to build on this current momentum
    and offer student entrepreneurs dedicated training and support to pursue their
    own startups. Aggie I-Corps offers the initial capital for participants to pursue
    their projects to the point of raising additional funding by leveraging the training
    and market research gained through the program. Aggie I-Corps positions STEM-based
    entrepreneurs to win follow-on funding through local competitions, federal funding
    applications and private investment solicitations. \n\nAggie I-Corps is having
    a significant impact on the improvement of the culture of entrepreneurship and
    innovation at NMSU, which yields dividends beyond the training and funding of
    Aggie I-Corps participants. The impact goes beyond the university and contributes
    to the regional ecosystem of entrepreneurship."

    The application of the Lean Launchpad (LLP) curriculum, intellectual networking
    events, access to business and scientific mentors, and funding mechanisms help
    participants in identifying the critical path to commercialization and ways to
    reach the market with innovative ideas more efficiently. UNH Innovation, which
    is the unit primarily responsible for entrepreneurial activities and technology
    commercialization at UNH, hosts the I-Corps Site.\n\nUNH's existing commercialization
    infrastructure is coordinated to increase the likelihood that research can be
    quickly exposed to the I-Corps program. At least 30 I-Corps Teams are trained
    each year and participate in the UNH Flywheel process. Highlights of this innovative
    process include:\n   (1) Exposure to a four-week Lean Launch Pad (LLP) course
    focusing on customer discovery and value proposition; \n   (2) A 10-week LLP course
    with exposure to the entire business model canvas; \n   (3) A demo day to showcase
    ideas; and \n   (4) Twice-yearly Sandpits, where multiple subject matter experts
    are invited to an open discussion on a general topic to promote interdisciplinary
    and trans-disciplinary conversations. \nPromising projects are connected to business
    mentors, are eligible for new translational funding, and are provided access to
    local incubator and angel/venture capital networks to accelerate market entry
    of ideas.\n\nImplementation of this I-Corp Site constitutes a redesign of the
    ecosystem in such a way as to increase interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary
    collaboration throughout UNH's $110MM research portfolio, and develop connections
    to available resources necessary to ensure that discoveries fulfill their economic
    and social potential. \n\nTo assess the impact of this redesign, this proposal
    contains an innovative approach to program assessment. While tracking well-established
    metrics such as invention disclosures, licenses, and startup activity, UNH also
    tracks qualitative and social network measures to help assess deeper changes in
    UNH?s innovation ecosystem. This more robust measurement approach not only assists
    in future improvements in UNH's innovation ecosystem, but also increases the scalability
    and transferability of lessons learned and insights gained at UNH?' I-Corps Site
    to the national innovation network.\n\nThe UNH Site impacts transcend exposure
    to and access by faculty and students to LLP coursework.  Startup formation and
    job creation are expanded as a direct result of UNH research and an improved culture
    of commercialization on campus. The UNH Flywheel process (1) exposes the regional
    and national business communities to UNH?s research capacity, (2) increases research
    collaborations between faculty and industry; and (3) improves connections between
    graduate students and the local business community. The program works with existing
    organizations on campus like the Society for Women Engineers, Luna Cats, UNH ADVANCE,
    UNH chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, and the Associate Vice
    President for Community, Equity, and Diversity to ensure recruitment and enrollment
    for programs is well advertised and broadens the participation of underrepresented
    cohorts in commercialization."

    at the University of New Hampshire'
- abstractText: "This project, from Dartmouth College, creates an Innovation Corps
    Site.\n\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established
    at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams
    to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure,
    advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
    groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
    Team applicants. \nI-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally
    and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs
    and investors.\n\nDartmouth's I-Corps Site provides intensive entrepreneurial
    training following the Lean LaunchPad curriculum and resources for customer discovery
    and market need analysis to 90-112 teams of students, faculty, researchers, and
    mentors.  The program bridges campus wide research in science, engineering, medicine,
    and student projects, all of which can lead to potential innovations - with Dartmouth's
    suite of entrepreneurial services offered through its Office of Entrepreneurship
    and Technology Transfer (OETT). \n\nThe intellectual merit of Dartmouth's I-Corps
    Site is the creation of a consistent curriculum that helps scientists, engineers,
    and students frame their discoveries in the context of how they can be used outside
    of the academic institution. The program helps a nascent entrepreneurs to place
    their discovery into one of three categories: continued academic exploration,
    pursuit of its use within the market discovered through program participation,
    or reevaluation with the intent of determining whether a market and need exists
    in a completely different area. \n\nThe objective of the Dartmouth I-Corps Site
    is to engage and equip more students and researchers at all levels - undergraduate,
    graduate, post-doctoral, and faculty - to move their discoveries out of academia
    and into the marketplace. Dartmouth I-Corps Lean LaunchPad workshops are held
    twice annually during Dartmouth's interim periods in December and June.  Using
    the workshops as a springboard and seed funding from the grant, teams perform
    customer discovery, form a value proposition, and determine market need and size
    beginning with the workshop and for a three-month period following the workshop.
    After completing the program, participants are prepared to either rethink their
    discovery or move forward with commercialization. If a team concludes that a discovery
    has commercial value, the team will be well positioned to take advantage of the
    support of the OETT, the NSF I-Corps program, Dartmouth's alumni support network,
    local angel investors, and other organizations.\n\nBroader Impacts: \nThe broader
    impacts of this program lie in its objective to create a campus environment that
    fosters innovation and produces graduates who understand and can engage in defining
    value and identifying need as they launch their careers. Dartmouth's enrollment
    of underrepresented minorities and women in its undergraduate and graduate STEM
    programs significantly exceed national averages; women represent 42% and 48%,
    respectively, of the current senior and junior engineering classes, and 30% of
    declared Computer Science majors. Sciences consistently enroll approximately 50%
    women. The engineering school's first-of-its-kind Ph.D. Innovation program, established
    in 2008, has graduated 30% women or underrepresented minorities. Feeders into
    Dartmouth's I-Corps Sites program come from courses and research laboratories
    from across Dartmouth's college of Arts & Sciences and three professional schools
    and all levels and engage these traditionally underrepresented populations in
    innovation as a natural outcome of the project activities. In order to broaden
    impact to the years beyond the I-Corps grant, investigators will use project outcomes
    to seek alumni support for offering of the Site curriculum and seed funding programs
    semi-annually."

    and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs
    and investors.\n\nThe objective of the TTU I-Corps Site is to strengthen the innovation
    ecosystem and entrepreneurial community in the TN region through the delivery
    of the I-Corps curriculum and support to 30+ teams per year. This activity will
    leverage existing partnerships between Tennessee Technological University (TTU),
    ORNL and the Biz Foundry to accelerate commercialization through training, enhanced
    education, and support of innovative research, while capitalizing on the existing
    university research infrastructure and the Launch Tennessee (LaunchTN) accelerator
    network. The TTU Site builds on the existing research experience at TTU by adding
    specific commercialization training and experience for teams that are composed
    of various combinations of students, faculty, members of industry and scientists.
    The TTU I-Corps Site expands the innovation and technical commercialization infrastructure
    at TTU by:\n     1) Building skill sets among students, faculty, engineers and
    community startups, and\n     2) Moving technology from academia, government,
    and industry toward commercialization. \nThis project achieves the goals of the
    Innovation Corps Sites Program by facilitating the translation of research, encouraging
    collaboration between academia and industry, and training students to understand
    innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E). This funding allows TTU to support teams
    whose projects are likely candidates for commercialization.\n\nThe innovation
    Site at TTU is built around the national I-Corps model, and its focused training
    experience, and consists of three stages to recruit, immerse and support technical
    entrepreneurs in the innovation and entrepreneurship lifecycle. The stages are:\n
    \    1) Team origination and recruitment \n     2) Formal I-Corps training\n     3)
    Post-training support\nThese stages are designed to improve the pathway to successful
    commercialization and develop the participants as better innovators and contributors
    to the NSF I-Corps network. \n\nTennessee (TN) state entrepreneurial startups,
    as exemplified by SBIR/STTR funding, fall in the 3rd quartile ranking with a 37%
    decrease in the past two decades. Until recently, most TN entrepreneurs have had
    limited or no access to training or opportunities to grow their startup. The TTU
    Site participates in and contributes to the broader knowledge of entrepreneurship
    research and its impact on engineering education and adds to the database of innovators
    in the NSF I-Corps network. In particular, this Site aids in understanding the
    role of entrepreneurship and innovation engineering education and its potential
    impact on: critical thinking; the network of emerging entrepreneurs and mentors;
    and, the addition of business students into the I-Corps model. The Site will investigate
    the early implementation of a quantitative, nationalized assessment model, based
    on the existing Critical Thinking Assessment (CAT) tool, appropriate for the I-Corps
    model that could be extended to train the larger innovation community."

    is a novel partnership involving two Historically Black Colleges and Universities
    (HBCUs), with assistance from the DC I-Corps Node, a regional I-Corps node supporting
    the DC-MD-VA region. The partnership supports enhanced participation of HBCU students
    and faculty from Howard and Hampton universities in technology transfer and venture
    creation by leveraging DC I-Corps' expertise in the Lean Launch Pad philosophy
    and curriculum. DC I-Corps benefits from the Site's regional alignment to accelerate
    the participation of African-Americans in future I-Corps Node cohorts thereby
    enhancing diversity. I-Corps activities on each campus and assessment of these
    targeted programs also informs strategies for improving innovation and entrepreneurship
    interventions aimed at under-represented minorities (URM) and enhance ongoing

    original research and new technologies by providing financial support for prototypes
    and customer engagement. Lean Startup training will help teams discover their
    potential customers and product-market fit. \n\nNJIT's support for entrepreneurs
    has four main anchors: the Enterprise Development Center, a 100,000-sq.-foot high
    technology and life sciences business incubator; the newly established NJ Innovation
    Institute; the NJ Innovation Acceleration Center, an initiative of School of Management
    and the Office of Technology Development; and the NJIT Undergraduate Research

    in experiential research activities that can solve societal problems.  An NSF
    I-Corps Site at NJIT will help bridge one of the roadblocks to the commercialization
    of research by providing funds for the development of risky early-stage prototypes.
    Faculty/Student teams seeking financial support will be required to participate
    in Lean Startup training and entrepreneurial networking that will help them to
    transition from researchers to potential innovators and entrepreneurs. \n\nAn
    NSF I-Corps Site at NJIT will establish a robust pathway to market for original
    research and new technologies by cross-fertilizing academic, entrepreneurial,
    and corporate participation. The grant will further enhance NJIT's relationship
    with the entrepreneurial and corporate communities as we bring community members

    will create pathway for underrepresented teams to participate in the NSF I-Corps
    program and support the mission of promoting science and technology to advance
    the national health. By combining academic research activities with commercialization
    activities, the I-Corp Site at NJIT will foster experiential teaching, training,
    and learning for students and faculty. Students and faculty who learn to discover
    the path to commercialization will be able to view research discoveries with greater
    understanding.\n\nThe Kauffman Foundation has recognized that minorities are underrepresented
    among entrepreneurs. All entrepreneurs face resource constraints but the barriers
    to entrepreneurship may be insurmountable for economically disadvantaged students
    and students who don't have a strong network from which to derive resources. An
    NSF I-Corp Site at NJIT will draw students from one of the most diverse campuses
    within the US and will provide early stage funding to women, minorities, and economically
    disadvantaged participants on a meritocratic basis. \n\nLeveling the playing field
    will broaden participation from underrepresented groups and create a new class
    of technology entrepreneurs and will benefit society by helping to move ideas
    out of academic silos. Nearly all net new job growth in the US has come from the
    formation of new companies and the subset of new companies that have grown most
    rapidly has been technology-based companies, the sorts of technology startups
    that would be fostered at NJIT."

    Project Description:
    This effort involves the creation and implementation of an I-Corps Regional Node in DC/MD/VA (DMV) region through a partnership involving the University of Maryland College Park (UMD), the George Washington University (GWU), and Virginia Tech (VT). The proximity of the DMV node to the Washington, DC area's vibrant entrepreneurial R&D ecosystem is providing a valuable set of resources to the national I-Corps network. The node is leveraging the respective strengths of the three institutions to help guide the transition of scientific discoveries into technologies and products that benefit society. It is implementing two initiatives that are specifically designed to increase the success rate of participating teams: (1) establishing a formal DMV I-Corps Mentor Network designed to attract, train, and retain top-notch mentors and (2) offering a post I-Corps Support program to help teams with a series of follow-on activities (e.g., continued customer development, minimum viable product prototyping, technology transfer and licensing, fundraising, legal services, and hiring executive talent). The node is implementing an Online Nodal Network (ONN) that ties together and augments existing tools (e.g., LinkedIn, YouTube, Google Docs, Quora, LaunchPad Central); addressing the needs that are particularly valuable to the nature of I-Corps teams. The ONN aggregates rich content and makes it more readily accessible to the I-Corps user community. It further enables the mentor network to pool and share their expertise with multiple I-Corps teams. In addition, the node is studying the effect of I-Corps training on: (1) any adjustments in orientation toward firm creation, (2) the proportion of teams that reach initial profitability, (3) the time required to reach initial profitability, and (4) the resources expended (time, money) in the start-up process.

    Broader Significance:
    In addition to providing training to NSF team cohorts, the DMV node is managing a Regional DMV I-Corps program that is designed to train an additional 150 teams over a three-year period. Thirty-five of the top two hundred U.S. universities in R&D expenditures are within a 4-hour drive of the DMV node. The node is focusing on attracting teams from these top regional academic institutions, as well as from the many federal and state research labs that are unique to the DMV region (e.g., NASA, NIH, ARPA-E). The node is also engaging underrepresented minority participation and HBCUs through cooperation with the Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Science, Inc. (GEM) consortium. It is implementing a GEM-endorsed initiative to increase the awareness of research commercialization opportunities. Small grants are being directed to promising HBCUs' teams in order to provide innovation training. The node is additionally leveraging the DMV's mentor network to support the HBCU teams.

- abstractText: "Building a US innovation network (I-Corps) node in Michigan\n\n\nProject
    Description\n\nThis project is establishing a founding network node at the University
    of Michigan (UMich) to successfully replicate the I-Corps curriculum at geographically
    distributed regions throughout the nation and further study how innovation permeates
    the academic culture. Although the current I-Corps program trains the nation's
    researchers in cutting-edge customer development methods, it does not offer additional
    support for start-ups once the go/no-go decision is made. Providing such support
    to local teams can offer great benefit, since most researchers are unlikely to
    relocate to the most active geographical regions of entrepreneurial activity.
    Building a robust network of innovation nodes across the country is critical to
    help support potential startups; therefore, this project offers a path toward
    leveraging a connected group of knowledgeable and highly experienced groups to
    help mitigate the issues and risks associated with creating new enterprises.\n\nThe
    UMich node will deliver the I-Corps hypothesis/validation-based (Lean LaunchPad
    - LLP) curriculum that focuses on Customer Development Methodology to cohorts
    of NSF-designated teams on a semi-annual basis. This will allow for training and
    development of I-Corps teams in an alternate location, while additionally increasing
    the breadth/depth of training and helping to scale the overall impact of the I-Corps
    program. UMich organized a team of trainers to present the I-Corps curriculum
    to I-Corps teams and help expand the pool of prospective I-Corps faculty who are
    able to teach the I-Corps curriculum, work with the selected teams, and help to
    further inform the national innovation network.\n\n\nBroader Significance\n\nThe
    establishment of an I-Corps node at the UMich is fostering the pursuit of both
    short-term and long-term research and development projects to help achieve the
    goals of the NSF I-Corps program. The node is researching, analyzing, and leveraging
    data from the I-Corps education, training and opportunity development efforts
    to: 1) develop an understanding of how institutions can improve support for innovation
    ecosystems; 2) create and share methods for successfully scaling effective practices
    and models that foster innovation; 3) explore how the network can enable new collaborations
    among geographic regions to support commercialization opportunity development,
    independent of geographic locations; 4) examine and track the I-Corps teams' dynamics,
    activities, and outcomes; and 5) identify and propose improvements to the I-Corps
    curriculum materials, training practices, and national innovation network utilization.
    \n\nThe UMich node is expanding the I-Corps cadre of innovation experts that are
    disseminating effective practices, fostering a change in culture (particularly
    in academia) and helping to mentor others in their business development efforts
    on a national scale. The UMich node has the potential to have a positive influence
    on future research direction at all universities. While the I-Corps training program
    doesn't increase overall research activity, it encourages a culture among university
    researchers to pursue areas in which there are confirmed industrial/societal needs.
    Furthermore, UMich has a set of existing entrepreneurship programs that can be
    leveraged to support I-Corps."

    North Carolina consisting of many economically distressed communities. While ECU's
    student population of 29,000 students derive from throughout North Carolina and
    beyond, 50% of its students are from the region east of Interstate 95. This area
    has traditionally benefited from industries in support of agriculture, forestry
    and fishing. Textile manufacturing played a vital role in the economy but overseas
    labor drew away many of these jobs. Many of ECU's students find a lack of available
    jobs in their home towns once they graduate with newly acquired skills so they
    leave home to find jobs elsewhere. For these reasons, much of ENC has faced declining
    populations. Eight of 31 counties in this region have experienced negative population
    growth of 15% to 33% and thirteen other counties have growth of 0% of -14%. These
    factors directly affect the pipeline of ECU students who are forced to find employment
    while attending college. 71% of first year ECU students report the need to secure
    part time employment while attending college. ECU's vision of success for the
    I-Corps Site is to build an innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem that will
    generate jobs for every student growing up in eastern North Carolina. The partnerships

    This project, from George Washington University, creates an I-Corps Site at this institution. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The George Washington University Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OI&E) collaborates with multiple units on campus to dramatically increase student and faculty teams from the STEM disciplines in OI&E innovation and commercialization activities. There is a strong network of mentors who are key in this process. OI&E developed multiple versions of the Lean Startup curriculum and will continue to do so to meet the special needs of undergraduate students, women, minorities, and veterans in the STEM disciplines. OI&E is also creating courseware in support of experienced entrepreneurs, investors, and business professionals who have not yet learned to apply lean startup methods. Doing so brings value to an entire startup ecosystem that is important to startup success. The broader impacts include spreading entrepreneurial thinking among the faculty, developing a well-trained cadre of mentors and adding to the diversity of the pool of mentors, especially women and veterans. These are important goals in entrepreneurship and commercialization and the project is specific about how this Site will advance these broader impacts.

    startup activity on campus not only by providing funding and training to startup
    teams, but also by helping create a faculty and student population that is familiar
    with the business startup process. It also provides a pathway for underrepresented
    students to participate in STEM-related business startups. \n\nThe Site grant
    provides 90 teams (over a three year period) $3,000 in funding per team along
    with training in the startup process, creating a culture of business startup and
    technology commercialization activity on campus that will remain in place long
    after the three year I-Corp grant is completed. \n\nThe OSU I-Corp Site impact
    includes the creation of STEM-related startups, licensing opportunities, jobs
    in Oklahoma and beyond, and incentives that attract underrepresented student groups
    to participate in the program. Business startups are particularly important for
    Oklahoma because the state has few Fortune 500 companies and other large employers.
    An increase in STEM-related jobs in Oklahoma bolsters the economy and improves
    the educational experiences of the students that are involved, increasing their
    competitiveness not only as STEM students but as citizens of our state and nation."

    The intellectual merit of this proposal is that this program allows highly educated scientists and engineers to acquire real-life research experience and to bring the latest innovative theories and techniques from the academic community o the country?s entrepreneurial technology sector. By working in a cutting-edge laboratory where research and development are accomplished within a framework of expected business outcomes and business constraints, researchers learn to work in multidisciplinary teams and to apply their academic expertise to the important work of product development and application in a globally competitive environment. The small businesses benefit from the fresh insights and most current technological skills and training that the recent postdoctoral students would bring. The program puts those skills and that training to work at creative and inventive research companies which otherwise would not be able to afford such expertise. These pairings would provide active SBIR Phase II companies the opportunity to enhance innovative collaboration, strengthen scientific rigor, and quicken the pace of technological breakthrough. Fellows are also encouraged to publish their work within the overall publishing guidelines set by each participating company.


    The broader impact of this program is to broaden participation of underrepresented groups such as women, African
    Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders in small high-tech companies supported by the NSF SBIR/STTR program. ASEE has proposed stronger outreach strategies than implemented in the current grant to increase visibility and diversity by reaching out to institutions that supply a high number of candidates from underrepresented demographic groups. ASEE is strengthening its outreach by attending postdoctoral and professional organizational conferences that typically target women and underrepresented groups in STEM fields and by having a proactive presence in social media.

    of programs has been successful in fostering the growth of enterprises, including
    startups. The Stony Brook campus leads SUNY in technology transfer performance
    - invention disclosures, patent applications, issued patents, and executed licenses.
    Its economic development/ industry assistance programs, which assists companies
    of any size at any stage of development, has a track record of promoting company
    growth - more than 3,500 projects, completed with more than 800 companies, have
    generated more than $900 million in corporate revenues. The oldest and largest
    Stony Brook incubator has exited some 80 companies with a 55% success record.\n\nThe
    Stony Brook I-Corps Site will capitalize on the prospective talent within its
    own faculty and student body and the discovery and innovation generated by sponsored
    investments in its research programs. Stony Brook's Site will collaborate with
    the University's academic leadership to focus assets on discovering and nurturing
    a new target, the entrepreneur, and structuring access to assets -  including
    the Long Island REACH Hub - to maximize innovation impact and create a permanent,
    sustainable entrepreneurial pipeline as both beneficiary of and stimulus for a
    larger innovation network.  \n\nAs a region of 2.8M people with a $143B Gross
    Metropolitan Product (2012), Stony Brook's location, Long Island, is larger than
    19 states and a net contributor to New York's fiscal health. Its growth rate,
    however, has lagged the nation since 2010. Strengthening the regional innovation
    ecosystem may have long-term positive economic impacts across the state. Within
    the ecosystem itself, the Stony Brook I-Corps Site will not only transform the
    culture of the Stony Brook campus, creating a permanent vehicle to feed the new
    venture pipeline, which will be strengthened by a synergistic relationship with
    the proposed Long Island REACH Hub, but it will also broaden the impact of the
    established NYCRIN I-Corps Node, in which Stony Brook is a partner, by feeding
    it close to an additional 100 entrepreneurial teams over a three-year period.
    Regionally, the design of the Stony Brook I-Corps Site will extend the Site's
    impact by inviting entrepreneurial researchers from the region's other research
    institutions to participate."

    Oregon, particularly in the rural areas, tends to lag the nation in economic prosperity
    and recovery. Through facilitated launch of new startup companies, the OSU system
    may reduce unemployment through the creation of higher-wage positions in development,
    manufacturing and related support roles. Funded investments in ICS teams accelerate
    the transition of research to market by providing stronger curricular components
    and dedicated resources for prototyping. \n\nOSUAA works across all 11 university
    colleges, which allows for students to actively participate in the real-world,
    experiential aspects of moving research to the marketplace. The OSUAA also works
    closely with the four cultural centers on campus to ensure that traditionally
    underrepresented groups know about, have access to, and take advantage of OSUAA's
    learning opportunities."

- abstractText: |-
    The intellectual merit of this project at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is that the Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures (JHTV) and its accelerator team, FastForward, will support the commercialization of research and technologies to create an innovation ecosystem at the University, and more broadly, in the Baltimore region. This I-Corps Site award enables JHU to leverage research outcomes by providing teams with an essential stipend for customer discovery and prototyping and the ability to validate and test their hypotheses and confirm through customer discovery whether there is value in their technology in the marketplace. By actually getting out of the lab, researchers gain insights into the mindset of decision makers and the payers who may become their customers. This grant will enable the JHU Site to provide a better learning experience for its participants by providing additional, non-dilutive funds.

    For example, in the fall of 2015, JHU's Short Course cohort focused on life sciences and brought together teams from universities across the city. The focused approach allowed instructors to delve into the unique challenges faced by researchers commercializing technology in the life sciences space including the development of strategic partnerships and the need for greater evidence based research at a time when the life science industry is investing less in research and development and easing away from the risks of basic and translational research.

    The I-Corps Site at JHU fills the fundamental educational disconnect between invention and market that is not found inside a lab or classroom but only through customer interviews. The goal of the JHU I-Corps Site will be to advance the knowledge and understanding of the commercial potential of life and basic science research while providing access to the life science expertise of Johns Hopkins to include translation, partnering, and entrepreneurship for the greater National
    Innovation Network.

    Participants in the JHU Site include teams from other universities especially those with diverse populations such as University of Maryland Baltimore City, Morgan State University, and Coppin State University, fostering collaboration and economic growth in the city and beyond. Over five years, this grant will impact 150 JHU teams and to a minimum 45 non-JHU teams, each comprised of three team members, for a total of at least 585 participants.

    in the areas of academic entrepreneurship and innovation. The JSU Site:\n-Offers
    entrepreneurial training and development opportunities for faculty and student
    teams in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines
    to prepare them for participation in the NSF I-Corps Teams Program or for further
    commercialization; \n-Broadens the participation of underrepresented, specifically

    development; and \n-Builds the capacity of faculty and students to explore the
    translation of academic research into tools, products, services, etc. that are
    favorable candidates for commercialization. \nThese objectives are carried out
    through three major activities: \n-Twelve weeks of training for 30 STEM teams
    per year that emphasizes the role of customer discovery and the business model
    canvas in the journey toward commercialization.\n-A year-long series of academic
    entrepreneurship workshops offered to the teams as well as to the campus community\n-An
    end of the year Academic Entrepreneurship Networking and Engagement Session, hosted
    annually in conjunction with Mississippi Innovation Month and Global Entrepreneurship
    Week.\n\nWhile progress has been made in understanding how to support scholars
    in the transition of research and innovations from lab to market, little attention
    has been directed to the ways in which faculty and students at minority serving
    institutions may require different levels of support or engagement to be successful
    in their entrepreneurial efforts. Teaching-loads, service requirements, and limited
    resources may hinder faculty of color at minority serving institutions from venturing
    into entrepreneurship. Lack of exposure to STEM professionals and limited access
    to information regarding entrepreneurship may limit African American students?
    opportunities to participate in research based academic entrepreneurship. Situating
    an I-Corps Site within the JSU institutional contributes to greater understanding
    of the best practices for overcoming the obstacles that hinder people of color
    and women in STEM from participating in innovation and commercialization activities.\n\nThrough
    teaching and learning activities for faculty and students in STEM, and by actively
    engaging faculty and students of color in academic entrepreneurship, start-up,
    and commercialization training and customer discovery, the JSU Entrepreneurship
    Center/I-Corps Site plays a major role in broadening the participation of underrepresented
    populations in STEM related entrepreneurial activities. The increased participation
    of faculty of color impacts society and the community in particular by bringing
    to market the products, process, services, and/or tools that are the result of
    research from a diverse pool of scholars and thinkers. The pairing of underrepresented

    launched an NSF I-Corps site to enhance technology commercialization in southeastern
    Wisconsin. This site leverages the existing partnerships among five regional universities:
    University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Marquette University, Milwaukee School of Engineering,
    Medical College of Wisconsin, and Concordia University of Wisconsin. Southeastern
    Wisconsin has over 1,200 manufacturing companies with national and international
    markets and partnerships covering the entire globe across most industry segments.
    \n\nBy establishing the site, a robust framework is created for I-Corps team formation
    and development, thereby increasing the volume of commercialization activities
    and success rates in securing resources needed for business formation and development.
    \ The UWM site addresses three important needs of academic institutions and industry
    in Southeastern Wisconsin: (1) a need to increase the activity level related to
    commercialization of applied academic research and faculty/student innovation,
    (2) a need to build an innovation/commercialization network that would provide
    multifaceted support to faculty and/or student ventures, and (3) a need to broaden
    the pool of students and faculty fluent in LLP methodology. \n\nUWM leveraged
    Federal Economic Development Authority support by investing $8M in building the
    Innovation Accelerator at the new UWM Innovation Campus adjacent to the Medical
    College of Wisconsin (MCW), the Blood Research Institute of Wisconsin, two major
    Wisconsin hospitals, and GE Healthcare. The accelerator is used to achieve the
    site's curricular objectives. It satisfies low-resolution and more advanced prototyping
    needs of the teams working in the healthcare domain and provides a focus point
    for collaboration between MCW and UWM. Teams working in the advanced manufacturing
    domain leverage Milwaukee School of Engineering and UWM facilities and resources.
    The Global Water Center provides support for freshwater teams, while the UWM main
    campus is the hub for energy research teams. The UWM Research Foundation manages
    the site and coordinate the network.  \n\nThe broader societal impact of the proposed
    site include an increased volume of innovative technologies and solutions brought
    to consumers to solve problems in healthcare, energy, freshwater and other areas.
    The Site partners with existing outreach programs within member institutions.
    \n\nThe commercial impact of the UWM I-Corps Site will be measured by the number
    of teams and participants going through the LLP process, the number and value
    of submitted federal/state/local grant proposals, the success rate of submitted
    proposals, the capital raised, the number of startups launched, the number of
    technology licenses, and the number of new research collaborations between cohort
    teams and team members - all which benefit the region and the nation."

    groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
    Team applicants. \n\nI-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally
    and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs
    and investors.\n\nWith this project, the Alabama Innovation and Mentoring of Entrepreneurs
    center (AIME) at The University of Alabama expands their existing proof-of-concept
    center into an I-Corps Site, to accelerate the commercialization of marketable
    ideas at The University of Alabama. The Site nurtures science, technology, engineering
    and mathematics (STEM) faculty and students, with projects originating from student
    work, research, institutional or industrial projects, and creates a local innovation
    ecosystem that contributes to a larger, national network of mentors, researchers,
    entrepreneurs and investors. \n\nThe University of Alabama Site provides infrastructure,
    advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
    groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
    Team applicants. Working with their regional I-Corps Node at the Georgia Institute
    of Technology, The University of Alabama Site will improve and expand AIME's current
    innovation curriculum and training programs. Site funding offers entrepreneurial
    teams the opportunity to increase their chance of commercial success through funds
    for the acquisition of modest amounts of equipment or materials needed to fabricate
    prototypes, travel expenses to consult with potential clients or experts, or other
    resources needed to directly advance the goals of transitioning a team's project
    into the marketplace. In addition, the Site offers access to resources and training
    to the sponsored entrepreneurial teams in order to nurture UA faculty, staff and
    students to transition their innovative technologies into the marketplace. \n\nBroader
    Impacts:\nThe direct impact is to educate the UA community in technology commercialization,
    transition teams to becoming NSF I-Corps trained teams and form start-up companies.
    The potential long term impact is to provide them with the education and skills
    that will position them to become part of the knowledgeable, creative workforce
    that will help the US maintain leadership in critical areas of science, technology,
    engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  The University of Alabama Site provides
    a formal structure to nurture entrepreneurial teams and guide the output of scientific
    discoveries closer to the development of technologies, products, and processes
    that benefit society. AIME has consistently recruited underrepresented STEM students
    and the Site will leverage the university's STEM Path to the MBA program and will
    encourage and advance minority participation in STEM-based entrepreneurial activities.
    In addition to impacting the university community, this Site program will enhance
    networking and partnerships through the involvement of AIME's mentors, who provide
    a network in their specific industries. Through providing a database of contacts,
    providing interaction with experts and providing top notch seminars, the University
    of Alabama Site has the opportunity to increase public participation in STEM activities
    by providing modest funds for prototypes and exploration into product-market fit,
    which increases the chance of commercial success. The University of Alabama Site
    has the opportunity to enhance the value of new ventures and make them better-positioned
    to hire employees and create transformative products and services for the benefit
    of society."

    The University of Delaware?s Venture Development Center serves as a hatchery/incubator
    for student startups and will do likewise for I-Corps teams. \n\nThis Site is
    likely to impact the ecosystem of the georgraphical region where this institution
    is located. In the past, Delaware benefitted from the presence of several large,
    hi-tech employers But, lingering effects from the economic downturn reduced the
    state's social and economic wellbeing. Consequently, an increase in startup activity,
    and the associated creation of new jobs, will serve to improve the economic wellbeing
    of Delaware and the surrounding region.  Broader impacts resulting from participation
    in the I-Corps Program will also include improved educational outcomes and competitiveness
    for STEM students, and stronger partnerships between academia and industry. The
    possibility of receiving funding and joining an I-Corps team may incentivize STEM
    students to learn about innovation and entrepreneurship by participating in existing
    training opportunities, thereby improving their educational outcomes and competitiveness.
    Stronger partnerships between academia and industry will result from interactions
    between I-Corps team members and prospective industry customers as well as the
    formation of I-Corps teams that will attempt to commercialize industry technology."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project impacts public health by providing small and versatile surgical instruments. These new tools, and the business models that facilitate wide deployment of them, have the potential to yield substantial public health impact. The tools will enable surgeons to perform surgery through needle-sized openings in the human body rather than large incisions. This will result in faster patient recovery and less pain. Also, less invasive surgeries should be expected to reduce hospitalization time and thus produce substantial financial savings for the national health care system. This I-Corps project will investigate the use of these new instruments in sinus surgery, eye surgery, and neurosurgery, among other clinical applications. Each of these are large potential markets for the technology.

    This I-Corps project is based on prior NSF-funded discovery that superelastic flexure elements can enable ultra-miniature deflectable surgical tools. The invention that forms the basis of this I-Corps project involves selective removal of material from a superelastic Nitinol tube to create an articulated instrument tip. This was motivated by the need for very small-diameter (needle-size) robot wrists. A goal of this I-Corps project is to determine whether it can be used in non-robotic hand-held surgical instruments to help surgeons access hard-to-reach locations in the human body (e.g. the sinus cavities or the ventricles in the brain). The I-Corps process will be used to determine whether customers prefer this device as a robotic system or as a non-motorized hand-held tool. It will also be used to determine which user interface is desired by surgeons in each surgical specialty, as well as which tip shapes are most valuable in each surgical procedure.

    Intellectual Merit:
    The United States faces significant challenges in rapidly and efficiently bringing emerging science and engineering innovations to use in industry and commerce. To maintain our world leadership in scientific and engineering research and education, we need processes that enable the practical and scalable application of promising discoveries from research and university laboratories. For university research to achieve greater impact, academic researchers and their students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) need tools and preparation for evaluating whether research discoveries can be readily translated into practical applications and eventual commercialization. For these reasons, NSF established the I-Corps training program in 2011 to support NSF-funded researchers in learning how to evaluate their scientific research for commercial potential. The National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance, Inc., d/b/a VentureWell, proposes to continue its work with NSF to plan, implement and evaluate five (5) additional I-Corps workshops (National Team Trainings) and two (2) National Faculty Training events.

    Broader Impacts:
    The I-Corps program provides NSF-funded principal investigators and their team members with funding
    and training enabling them to evaluate their technologies and research discoveries for commercial
    feasibility. The ultimate goal of the program is to increase the economic and societal impact of NSF
    research funding directly, through commercialization of research, and indirectly, by equipping scientists
    and engineers with skills and experience in developing and testing economically scalable models for the
    development of a product or technology. By the end of the program, I-Corps grantees are expected to
    reach a decision about the commercial readiness of their technology or product and take with them a set
    of skills that they can continue to apply in their research careers. Program participants evaluate and
    translate their research into applications that have commercial potential and can benefit society. Many
    participants will have identified promising commercial pathways that can lead to new high tech ventures
    or licensing opportunities. Since the program's inception, I-Corps teams have formed 350 companies that
    have attracted over $83 million in follow-on investment and grants. These companies operate in a broad
    range of sectors including health, energy, materials, agriculture and information technology and are
    geographically distributed across 43 states.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves providing significantly lower operating costs, broader material variety, and faster speeds than currently available with the fused-deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing process. As additive manufacturing transitions from a prototyping tool to manufacturing solution, the demand for fast, inexpensive, and dynamic 3D printing solutions will continue to grow. The Resin Mini-Extruder is capable of integrating with existing 3D printer electro-mechanical systems and processing raw plastic pellets (resin) directly into a final part, unlike existing FDM technologies that require a filament feedstock. Raw pelletized plastics are typically a tenth to hundredth the cost of comparable filaments, which allow for significantly lower costs per print. In addition, the proposed solution is capable of printing a wide variety of plastics that are very difficult to print with existing extruders, including thermoplastic elastomers and polymer composites. The Resin Mini-Extruder is capable of significantly faster production than existing FDM technologies, which will enable high turnover of design prototypes and production parts.

    This I-Corps project is based on prior NSF-funded research involving a design framework for biomimetic elasto-fluidic systems. The research inspired the invention of a novel technology for manufacturing elasto-fluidic actuators, which forms the basis of this I-Corps project. The technology, the Resin Mini-Extruder for additive manufacturing, is a screw-driven extrusion system, which includes a novel screw-drive extruder and dynamic control system. The intent is to implement the extruder with existing 3D printer electro-mechanical systems in a FDM additive manufacturing process. The invention of the Resin Mini-Extruder was motivated by the need to print materials that existing FDM technologies are incapable of processing, namely thermoplastic elastomers. A goal of this I-Corps project is to determine whether customers demand broader material variety from FDM and if so, which materials and composites are preferred. The I-Corps process will also be used to determine the extent at which the other technology advantages are valued among customers, including cost per print and print speed, in particular applications.

    at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams
    to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure,
    advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
    groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
    Team applicants. \n\nThe Merced Site is in cooperation with the Bay Area NSF Innovation
    Corps Node through the University of California, Berkeley. Merced will cultivate
    both innovation and teams that can meaningfully participate in the National Innovation
    Network to deliver innovation to society through the application of entrepreneurship.
    It will also develop methods for fostering innovation-based entrepreneurship in
    less diverse economies. UCMerced is in a rural, agricultural area of California
    that has not had much entrepreneurial activity in the past. However, in 2015 UCMerced
    established the Venture Lab which focuses on entrepreneurship and provides a locus
    of entrepreneurship in the greater community.\n\nThis is a unique Sites proposal
    given the age of the institution and their rural location. They have already created
    and succeeded with their Venture Lab and recruited a 10-member Advisory Board.
    The leadership is very experienced and has reached out to the surrounding community
    for collaboration and support and their connections are strong. Their curriculum
    is lean-centric. UCMerced has chosen a realistic Sites model - starting with 15
    Site teams the first year, then 20, ramping up to 30 in their final year of funding.\n\nThis
    is an unusual environment to pilot a program in an institution that is essentially
    minority populated and located in an area that is in need of a boost to its ecosystem.
    The project is likely to have a profound impact on both the institution and the
    community."

    This project by Cornell University will launch a new I-Corps Node centered in Upstate New York. I-Corps NY Node brings together Cornell University as the lead institution, the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) as partner institutions. This project will increase the velocity, volume, and success rate of technology startup teams forming in the colleges and universities in the Northeast, including Upstate NY. This new Node will adopt current best-practices in the Node network to grow a network of business mentors for academic inventors, promote lean launchpad principles in research, and expand entrepreneurship education around the region. The Node evaluation team will use iterative evaluation and redesign efforts to ensure the achievement of economic development, education, and workforce development outcomes. The researchers, instructors, mentors, and institutions in this Node will bring new ideas and tools to strengthen the National Innovation Network.

    This project will foster the inclusion of I-Corps participants, particularly underrepresented minorities, women, and the disabled in multiple regional I-Corps programs each year. In partnership with RIT's National Technical Institute for the Deaf, the Nation's largest engineering program for the deaf and hard of hearing, the Node will encourage nationwide participation from this underrepresented group. Programs will conclude with showcase events to publicize the teams and their success in regional innovation. This project will leverage a high concentration of academic anchor institutions to improve a moribund regional economy. Upstate NY academic institutions spend over $2.3bn on R&D, an amount that ranks eighth nationwide in state research spending. I-Corps represents an investment in growing a new innovation economy in a part of the country with tremendous assets to build upon and expand.

    by the campus-wide Carnegie Mellon Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship
    (CIE), is to implement a systematic and replicable agile startup methodology,
    focused on customer discovery and product adaptation. \n\nThe CMU I-Corps Site
    leverages Carnegie Mellon's strengths and past successes in fusing technology
    with entrepreneurship. Their Site utilizes CMU's network of internal and external
    contacts to train entrepreneurial faculty and student teams working in STEM fields.
    CMU's curricular model is based on the i6 Agile Innovation System and is consistent
    with the I-Corps Curriculum. It includes four elements: workshops, mentoring,
    funding for projects and customer discovery, and incubator space.\n\nThe objectives
    of the CMU Site are to: \n1) capitalize on CMU's culture of innovation by expanding
    programs to nurture entrepreneurial ventures and transition university research
    to the market; \n2) train individuals to understand basic motivations, processes,
    practices, and challenges of innovation and entrepreneurship;\n3) hone individuals'
    entrepreneurial practices and skills; \n4) collaborate with industry, entrepreneurs,
    and the business community in the region and nation. \n\nThe CMU program will
    recruit teams from: existing entrepreneurial activities, course projects, college
    liaisons, and an open call. Underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged
    to apply. Teams will be encouraged to avail themselves of enrichment opportunities
    such as funding avenues, venture competitions, and business events. Each team
    will have an Entrepreneurial Lead, an Academic Lead, and a Mentor.  \n\nThe assessment
    plan focuses on ascertaining the most effective components of an agile university
    entrepreneurship training program. Teams' milestones and customer contacts will
    be tracked. Formative assessment using tools such as pre-, mid-, and post-program
    surveys will inform the CMU program evolution.\n\nOf particular merit is this
    proposed Site's agile and adaptable customer-based training program, components
    of which have been shown to be successful in programs such as the i6 Agile Innovation
    System and the I-Corps Curriculum/Lean Launch Pad. Combining these components
    -- and then distilling through assessment and evaluation which of them are especially
    effective at spurring creativity, resourcefulness, independence, and connectivity
    -- will further entrepreneurial knowledge and education. The program will also
    teach entrepreneurial students and faculty how to create their own ecosystem by
    engaging in customer discovery and network building. \n\nThe CMU I-Corps Site
    plans to move university research out of the lab more efficiently and effectively.
    Expediting the movement of academic innovation to the commercial sector allows
    new, often government-funded, university discoveries and inventions to reach the
    public sector earlier spawning new endeavors and economic growth. All sectors
    of society and areas of inquiry -- healthcare, energy, sustainability, global
    communication, for example, can see benefits. In addition, making earlier decisions
    about viability of commercial outcomes is beneficial as it can more effectively
    utilize critical resources --time, energy, talent, and funds. In addition, a successful
    Site will likely impact the Pittsburgh, Steel Valley, and Allegheny Valley communities."

    marketplace from earlier stages of research discoveries.\n- Increase awareness
    and participation in technology commercialization among the broader UCSD research
    and student community, in particular among females and underrepresented minorities.
    \n- Provide real world experiential learning to the student teams participating
    in the process while facilitating access to the region?s innovation ecosystem
    and entrepreneurial support network. \n- Expand the suite of offerings that the
    von Liebig Center can provide to students and faculty for its services to the
    earlier stages of technology translation. \n- Collaborate on ?best-practices?
    by becoming a member of an I-Corps Site network that shares insights with a wide
    community of similar centers in the Nation.  \n\nThese goals will be accomplished
    through entrepreneurship curricula, identification, selection, and intervention
    activities, mentoring, and assignment of resources for early stage development
    - all of which contribute to the academic research translation process through
    the creation of an integrated, experiential, educational program that focuses
    on the training of academic innovators while they are still engaged in the early
    stages of the discovery process. \n\nThe vLC has solid processes in place for
    recruiting, vetting, and supporting teams through their I-Corps Site. They have
    many noteworthy examples of startups they have supported through their existing

    state of California. \n\nBroader Impact:\n\nThe vLC I-Corps SIte will strengthen
    and broaden the pipeline of innovations from the university while promoting entrepreneurial
    thinking and activities to thrive in the academic environment. \n\nBy encouraging
    student and faculty/researcher participation actively translating research to
    early stage development, new products or services will be launched resulting in
    the creation of high value jobs and economic growth in the region. \n\nEntrepreneurial
    students from underrepresented groups will have a support network inside the university
    that will give them the confidence needed to thrive and participate in the process.
    \n\nOutcomes will be widely disseminated by becoming a member of the NSF I-Corps
    Site network, thus catalyzing innovation in technology discoveries. The most important
    impact of this proposed approach is building entrepreneurial principles, early-stage
    commercialization pipelines, and early-stage incubation schemas. These practices,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project potentially include dramatically improved emergency-response systems for public safety in a number of different scenarios ranging from active shooter threats in college or enterprise campuses, emergencies involving fire or police departments, medical response teams in indoor hospital buildings or outdoor settings. The commercial impact of this effort is to potentially transform the mass alerting market today. The planned customer research will also help inform and enhance the underlying networking and distributed systems technology for agile contextual communication and, in the longer term, fundamentally advance our understanding of how to realize a next-generation Internetwork, research on which contributed to the origins of the underlying contextual communication technology driving this I-Corps project.

    This I-Corps project activity builds upon contextual communication, a technology that enables powerful new mobile communication capabilities that are highly customizable to the needs or preferences of individual users or groups. For example, in the event of a campus emergency, emergency managers can send hyperlocal alerts to specific buildings based on real-time locations of users, and such alerts can be further customized to special needs of users trapped in the building. The underlying research advances making contextual communication practical originated from a "future Internet architecture" project that showed that it is possible to generalize name- or IP-address-based communication in today's Internet to communication based on arbitrary contextual attributes such as geo-location, age, and special needs. Research results show that it is possible to provide contextual communication services in a scalable (or cost-effective), privacy-preserving, and accurate manner for a broad class of mobile applications, including but not limited to emergency notification, an application domain of particular interest to this I-Corps customer research project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to understand product application opportunities in the evolving textile electronics industry. Textile electronics is a field which requires that new technologies adoption meets the stringent cost and comfort requirements of the textiles industry, while maintaining the rigid device performance metrics of the electronics industry.  The opportunity exists through this I-Corps project to understand the tradeoffs between a transformative process technology with the ability to form cost effective, customized textile electronics products in fitness/wellness, health/medical, industrial/military, and fashion/infotainment markets.

    This I-Corps project will explore the market potential for a transformative electronic interconnect technology applicable to the fabrication of low-cost garment-based wearable devices.  The technology focused upon in this work allows for the ability to retro-fit garments with electronics by simple heat iron-on strategy, similar to placement of a heat laminated tag or manufacturer logo.  This technology is an alternative to conductive yarn and bulky wires used currently in textile electronics, materials which limit scale-up of wearables to small quantities and results in a bulky garment that is uncomfortable to the wearer.  This iron-on technology allows for the ability to connect multiple devices on a garment in a low cost, customizable way and enables a strategic expansion of the textile electronics product landscape. This I-Corps project seeks to understand the opportunities for the technology through a voice-of-customer analysis of the key stakeholders in the textile electronics industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in underwater wireless communications and wireless sensor networks.  The innovative underwater wireless communication technology is highly desirable for enabling real-time wireless sensing and data communication. The reduced cost and improved reliability will enable wide-spread applications of underwater wireless communication system and will greatly enhance the capability of ocean big data acquisition and underwater infrastructure monitoring. The commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the successful technology transfer to field products, which in turn can make huge impact on ocean instrumentation, offshore environmental observation, infrastructure (bridge, oil pipe, river bank, levee) monitoring, subsea oil drilling, fishing industry, diver communications, underwater mine operation, and coastal surveillance with torpedoes, underwater robots, and unmanned underwater vehicles.

    This I-Corps project aims at developing a business plan for transferring the innovative underwater wireless communication technology into field products. The hostile ocean/river/lake environment imposes tremendous challenges for underwater wireless communications. Currently, the available acoustic transceivers are mainly second-generation technologies developed in 1990s, which suffer from either high cost or low robustness against changing environment. The innovative Turbo equalization algorithms for single-carrier modulation acoustic communications exhibit high reliability, high performance, and low hardware cost, and have been recognized as the third generation technology in underwater wireless communications.  This I-Corps project will focus on three major tasks: 1) identify the value proposition, 2) analyze the revenue streams by discovering customer segments, revenue channels, and customer relationships, and 3) analyzing cost structure by studying key activities, key resources, and key partners. The goal of this project is to help transferring this underwater wireless technology into field products that exhibit low cost and high reliability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves the increasing demand for cell, tissue, and organ preservation which has resulted in a fast-expanding market of biopreservation. Preservative effectiveness largely depends on the technology of biopreservation solutions or media, where the properties and concentrations of the ingredients in the solutions play essential roles. Regular (or conventional) reagents in biopreservation solutions are usually alcohol-based or salt-based, which have considerable drawbacks including low effectiveness, cytotoxicity, and environmental impact. The technology of Antifreeze Polypeptide-Based (AFP) system can overcome the drawbacks of conventional reagents in biopreservation solutions. The I-Corps team will conduct customer-based research that include customer discovery, market research, and exploring commercial applications of AFP-based technology for biopreservation including proof-of-concept studies suggested during customer discovery.

    This I-Corps project is focused on a technology to improve biopreservation. Antifreeze polypeptides (AFPs) and certain small molecules are naturally produced by organisms, such as fish, insects, and plants, for their survival in extreme cold environments. AFPs are known to inhibit ice growth by binding to specific ice crystal surfaces. The freezing inhibition by AFPs is non-colligative, which is superior to regular/conventional antifreezes (e.g., sodium chloride, ethylene glycol). Recently, certain small molecules that do not exhibit non-colligative antifreeze properties, but can efficiently enhance the antifreeze effect of AFP over 10 times have been identified. More recently, the role for AFPs in inhibiting the formation of crystals in addition to ice has been revealed. In particular, AFPs can control the crystallization of certain carbohydrates and nucleosides much more effectively (comparing to their role in controlling ice crystallization) where these molecules often act as protectant molecules in biopreservation. Because of its highly effective, eco-friendly, and multifunctional characteristics, the proposed AFP-based system could be a potential advanced technology for biopreservation. The goal of this I-Corps team is to further investigate the value of this technology to the biopreservation market.

    The increased prevalence of drug-resistant organisms has become a major concern for world health over the last 30 years. Compounding this threat is the fact that the rate at which new antibiotics are discovered has decreased significantly. Steps must be taken to increase the rate of discovery. The proposed product will be significant in the fight to develop new antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial and fungal pathogens that are the most problematic to human health. This team plans to provide scientists the tools they need to efficiently and effectively develop new therapeutics to treat infections.  This I-Corps team will produce research-only, off-the-shelf consumable products containing panels of microorganisms to facilitate the initial screening of chemical libraries for the development of novel antimicrobials. The proposed product line will include panels of different microorganisms to facilitate the drug development process, such as the development of broad spectrum antibiotics or antibiotics that target specific problematic microbes. These products will eliminate the client's requirement to perform costly and labor intensive growth and assay preparations, reduce the assay preparation time by up to one week as well as decreasing experimental variability and increasing automation.

    During the I-Corps training program, the team will conduct numerous customer interviews to determine what types of microbial panels are of most interest to its potential customers and what pricing structure is acceptable.  The team will also plans to build a prototype. Post I-Corps, the I-Corps team will seek funding for continued product development and manufacture.  Steps will be taken during this time to develop an IP portfolio to protect the team's proposed process and other proprietary information;  and regulatory, copyright, and trademark studies will be undertaken.  Branding will be integral for the valuation of the future company as it stands to be the first to exploit this new market opportunity.  Following maturation of the proposed product line, investment capital will be pursued for brand development, advertisement, distribution, and legal consultation.

- abstractText: "Project Description:\nThis project involves the creation of a Regional
    I-Corps Node in the northern California Bay Area (Bay Area Node) through a partnership
    of the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), the University of California,
    San Francisco (UCSF), and Stanford University. It is producing an extensive entrepreneurship
    platform that is built on the scientific, technology, and engineering strengths,
    business thought leadership, and external ecosystems of the three universities.
    The Node is applying and disseminating the Lean LaunchPad methodology through
    classes, focused training, and mentoring services to help drive the creation of
    science and technology-based startups. \n\nThe partners are investigating how
    I-Corps Node training influences research commercialization outcomes and exploring
    ways to better understand the early stages of team formation and evolution, formation
    and evolution of advising networks, timing and content of decisions, and real-time
    attention allocation. The Node is also studying the formation of entrepreneurial
    teams and ways to measure team evolution and effectiveness, in order to better
    understand how they can be supported in their efforts to commercialize invention.
    Teams are being monitored (post-training) to observe their outcomes and determine
    whether they are optimizing activities for success. The LaunchPad Central website
    and online mentoring platform is enabling the team to aggregate/analyze the data
    and examine what makes technology commercialization efforts succeed or fail.\n\nBroader
    Significance:\nThe Node is producing both regional and national impact by raising
    awareness of the value of entrepreneurship among science and engineering faculty
    and students and enhancing the online availability of Lean LaunchPad principles.
    By providing much of the education, team tracking, and mentoring online, the Bay
    Area Node is creating a scalable startup ecosystem that allows content and business
    processes to be readily updated. It offers a highly instrumented ecosystem that
    is tracking progress and measuring program effectiveness; thus creating a continuously
    improving program that is positively impacting the production of science and technology-based
    startups both locally and nationally. The data, resources and outcomes/results
    are being disseminated using methods that allow others, outside of the Bay Area,
    to participate in the training. \n\nThe Node is facilitating the inclusion of
    groups from diverse regions, economic backgrounds, and ethnicities in developing
    effective entrepreneurship. It is studying whether mentoring networks can provide
    the status and diversity contributions that teams with demographic disadvantages
    often lack. The data and results are made freely available via the website so
    that advancements can be quickly implemented and globally shared. New curriculum
    modules are also addressing a broader array of subjects including: mentor training,
    healthcare and life sciences, energy and clean technology, as well as legal and
    finance related issues."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it will potentially reduce fatal errors associated with compounded sterile preparations (CSP).  This will save lives and save money by preventing dose errors and wastage of costly medications and accessories when CSP's are incorrectly made. This I-Corps project will also explore similar problems that can also have life threatening consequences. The project will help to discern how various types of errors encountered in industrial processes can be minimized by integrating technology and human intervention at various workplaces. The product will help to gain understanding about how machines and people interact so as to design better workflow practices related to the CSP preparation and other relevant health care/industrial processes. The design of the technology allows usage in virtual simulation centers and other educational settings to train technical personnel, students, and professionals.

    This I-Corps project involves a computational decision support system (CDSS) product that was developed to address severe shortcomings in compounded sterile preparations (CSP).  Current procedures can result in fatal errors, inappropriate techniques, and noncompliance issues.  The first feature of the CDSS is an audio-visual interface for the compounding technician to identify and pick the correct materials and accessories to prepare a CSP. The second feature of the CDSS tracks, monitors, and evaluates the methods used by a technician compounding the injectable medication through image and video processing. The third feature of the CDSS checks and confirms the volume of a liquid injection contained in a syringe. The CDSS product can digitally document all the steps during this process enabling real time feedback during compounding so that errors can be corrected immediately. The technology also records the techniques used during compounding to ensure that proper procedures were followed according to regulatory guidelines. The CDSS thus provides timely warnings and real time feedback during preparation of a CSP and documents all aspects of the process that can be fully integrated with quality assurance (QA) programs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the opportunities of using a new technology to help manufacturers make carbon fiber composite products with higher production speed and lower cost. This novel fabrication technology produces materials that are stronger, stiffer, thinner, lighter, and better conductors of heat and electricity than current carbon fiber composites widely used in manufacturing industries. Parts produced from these new materials are more accurately made and have less internal stress remaining after manufacturing than previously. In addition, this technology will also reduce the energy consumption and material waste during the operation of vehicles and equipment that utilize them. Since carbon fiber composites are being increasingly used in many industries including aerospace, automotive, energy, marine, sporting goods, and defense, successful commercialization of the new technology catalyzed by this I-Corps project will bring significant benefits to the U.S. manufacturing base.

    This I-Corps project is based on a new technology using long ultra-thin carbon nanofibers to thread through a bed of conventional thicker carbon fibers all surrounded by an epoxy resin adhesive. As a result, the thicker fibers are strongly bound together by the nanofibers, and all are held in place by the epoxy, to produce a composite material that is much stronger than either the epoxy resin alone or the conventional carbon fiber composite including the epoxy. This is called "z-threading". The network of interlocked carbon nanofibers and carbon fibers significantly improves the composite material's strength and conduction of heat and electricity. Conventional carbon fiber composite materials, typically in the form of a laminate, lack the z-threading nanofibers and have significantly poorer properties across the thickness direction of the laminate. As a result, manufacturing processes currently using carbon fiber composites will be significantly improved. This will allow production of more aggressively designed components with higher performance than has been possible before.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to evaluate the commercial potential of a new imaging modality that can reliably measure blood perfusion. The system will enable surgeons to visualize and analyze blood flow at a surgical site in real-time, thereby assisting them in making better clinical decisions in the operating room, reduce the rate of post-operative complications, leading to overall reduction in healthcare costs. The current state-of-the-art for blood perfusion imaging is either based on injecting a contrast agent into the bloodstream and are therefore invasive with potential side-effects, or based on sophisticated Laser-based imaging device which can be difficult to operate during surgery. The system developed here relies only on the video recordings of the observation site to reliably estimate blood perfusion, and hence is both non-invasive and is easy-to-use. Beyond surgery, there is a potential of using the system to monitor critical care patients and also as a point-of-care device in podiatry, especially for the early detection of diabetic neuropathy.

    This I-Corps project further develops a non-contact, non-invasive, camera-based and clinically accurate blood perfusion measurement system. Using low-cost, mass-produced hardware, combined with sophisticated signal processing algorithms, the system can estimate blood perfusion maps in real time.  The key innovation lies in: (i)  data fusion from multiple sensors - camera and pulse oximeter, (ii) a new computational imaging and signal processing algorithm to recover blood perfusion  below the skin, from videos of the skin surface, and (iii) a novel approach to compensate motion of the imaged tissue surface. The technology can work not only with video recordings of the external tissue, such as skin surface, but also internal tissue and organs, such as during a minimally invasive surgery with a laparoscope. The system has been successfully demonstrated in detecting small changes in blood perfusion during partial and full occlusion of the blood vessels.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the practical deployment of a computer-vision based yield estimation system in fruit orchards.  With this technology, the farmers will be able to obtain a map of the number  and size of fruit across their farms from images recorded by a standard camera. This capability will provide farmers with a useful tool in planning their harvest and sales, as well as in managing the long-term health of their plants.  It  will also potentially reduce the inherent risk in fruit growing, thereby improving the affordability and availability of fresh fruit in the US.  Furthermore, by allowing the adoption of precision agriculture techniques to high value crops, this project may help save water and contribute to reduction of runoff pollution from fertilizer and chemicals.

    This I-Corps project addresses the task of customer discovery for applications of the technology of vision-based yield detection and mapping in fruit orchards.  The core of the technology is a set of computer vision algorithms to detect fruit in images under natural farm conditions. This application presents several computer vision task challenges.  Fruit may be occluded by leaves and other fruit. Shadows and specularities make color information unreliable. Also, fruit across frames are matched to avoid double counting. Geometric algorithms are used for estimating fruit diameter. This I-Corps project will allow for customer discovery in this and other market spaces, test the product-market fit for the proposed yield estimation technology, and guide future  technology development in this area.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project concerns the rehabilitation of movement deficits due to disease or injury. Commercially, the project falls within the rehabilitation robot market, specifically the segment that addresses neurological rehabilitation. Currently, available robotic rehabilitation technology focuses mainly on the recovery of motor function after stroke and restricts patient motion to a single plane. This project involves a robotic device that extends the scope of current rehabilitation robots by a) allowing unrestricted 3D movement, and b) incorporating somatosensory in addition to motor training methods. The commercial potential of this I-Corps project is not restricted to clinics specializing on stroke rehabilitation. The device can be used on a broad disease spectrum that includes stroke, but can be extended to patients with Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and traumatic brain injuries.

    This I-Corps project further develops a robotic rehabilitation device that seeks to improve wrist/hand function. The robot comprises a series of motors that can passively move the human wrist/hand, or assist/resist active human wrist motion. It allows for unrestricted 3-dimensional motion while precisely recording wrist joint motion. The system is integrated with a visual virtual reality environment that can provide movement feedback and can serve as an interface for visual-based training regimes. The technology has been tested in over 300 human users aged 18-82 years. It has been applied to assess sensory and motor dysfunction in stroke survivors and patients with Parkinson's disease. Test-retest reliability and validity of its outcome measures has been established.

    The broader impacts and commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the progress toward developing a treatment delivery system for individuals with debilitating fears.  The system, based on augmented reality and virtual reality, addresses significant limitations of other treatment modalities. Approximately 9% of adults in the United States experience a clinically significant phobia that causes impairments in functioning at high cost to the individual and society. Despite the functional impairment caused by the debilitating fears characteristic of Specific Phobia, nearly 2/3rds of individuals do not seek treatment likely due to the aversive qualities of the most effective treatment, exposure therapy. Untreated, phobias can have significant economic impact on society. Therefore, the technology in this project has broader impacts to society by improving access to treatment through delivery through a more acceptable modality.  Customers are expected to be licensed mental health practitioners and the product will allow them to expose their patients to computer generated phobic stimuli via an augmented reality (AR) headset. The technology will allow clinicians to adopt a therapy delivery system that is more acceptable to clients, while reducing clinician time and overall treatment costs.

    This I-Corps project will involve conducting customer discovery interviews to test product-market fit for the development of an augmented reality (AR) platform that allows people to overcome debilitating fears characteristic of Specific Phobia. The project is based on research indicating that only a minority of individuals with this highly treatable disorder obtain intervention services because typically-delivered exposure therapy has highly aversive qualities. Approximately 1 in 4 patients reject the treatment when it is introduced. However, research also indicates that the same treatment delivered in virtual reality (VR) environments is a highly preferred therapy modality with a low rejection rate (3%). Unfortunately, this approach is not widely adopted by therapists because the time to create a complete VR environment with the fear stimulus is costly, resulting in poor product-market fit. With the rapid development of AR-based technology and the low-cost of rendering AR environments relative to VR environments, this I-Corps project offers the benefits of VR-assisted therapy (lower patient rejection rates/higher patient preference) while avoiding the barriers to clinician adoption.  This technology is expected to increase patient access to and engagement in treatment, while simultaneously reducing clinician time and costs spent preparing for individual exposure tasks.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is addressing the increasing demand for sustainable water purification and cost-effective phase separation with an energy-efficient, economical, portable and scalable solution. More than a billion people around the world lack access to clean drinking water. Most of the existing technologies for water purification and phase separation mainly use energy from conventional fuels increasing their operating cost and limiting their application. The proposed technology of Nanophotonics-enabled Solar Membrane Distillation (NESMD) uses solar energy to vaporize water and potentially other liquids of interest. NESMD system is energy-efficient, portable and can be scaled in size making it suitable for household, commercial and industrial water purification. Cost-effective phase separation with NESMD can be attractive for petroleum and related industries as well.

    This I-Corps project focuses on electricity-free water purification and phase separation. Nanophotonics-enabled Solar Membrane Distillation (NESMD) system consists of a polymer membrane coated with light-absorbing carbon-based nanomaterials which efficiently absorb incident sunlight. The capability of converting light into heat within a thin layer on top of a semipermeable membrane allows an efficient local conversion of liquid to its vapor phase. This membrane can be used in contact with saline/polluted water or a mixture of organic solvents allowing the heat from the absorbed sunlight to induce vaporization through the membrane separating the liquid of interest from non-volatile components such as salts, heavy metals, bacteria or other liquids. Proof-of-concept lab-scale studies of the NESMD system show efficient water purification with more than 99.5% salt rejection. Through this I-Corps project the team wants to further assess and investigate the value of this technology for water purification and phase separation market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is an improvement in the safety of food products. In particular, this I-Corps project aims to identify a customer base for a novel biosensing technology using printed floating-gate transistors (FGTs). FGTs are a platform-technology that can be used to detect any analyte that can be captured using an antibody or a special sequence of single-stranded DNA, known as a DNA aptamer. The most likely direction for commercialization is gluten detection. The growing industry of gluten-free foods is valued at $2.8 billion/year. These foods are critical to people suffering from celiac disease, which affects 1% of the population. The FGT platform can also be adapted to other allergens, clinically relevant proteins, or even microorganisms. The continued advancement and commercialization of this technology thus has broader impacts in food safety, and potentially for biomedical and clinical environments.

    This I-Corps project is motivated by the development of a new transistor-based sensing strategy that combines printed electronic and microfluidic technologies. Existing transistor-based sensing technologies pose a difficult materials science problem, wherein the transistor material needs to have outstanding electronic properties as well as stability in the biosensing environment. In contrast, the sensor electronics in the technology under development here are decoupled from the fluidic environment through a side-gate architecture. Published research has established that this platform can detect DNA and proteins. It is thus a flexible platform for biosensing. The research in this project focuses on customer discovery to identify promising directions for commercialization. The initial customer discovery will focus on the food safety industry, with the aim of determining whether gluten detection is the optimal entry point to this market. Subsequent activities will broaden the customer discovery efforts to identify targets in the biomedical and clinical areas.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce snoring and sleep apnea using a software that resides on a smartphone. There are over 90 million Americans who suffer from snoring and 25 million Americans who suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Snoring is a pervasive social problem that greatly reduces the quality of life of individuals, partners, and families and has been tied to negative health outcomes. The current treatments for snoring are often ineffective, too expensive or burdensome. Snoring is also associated with the medical condition of OSA which is linked to serious health conditions such as hypertension, stroke, heart disease, arrhythmias, diabetes, depression, and increases the risk of cancer mortality. In addition, there is also a considerable economic cost associated with OSA. This I-Corps project is a completely new approach to address the root cause of both snoring and sleep apnea and will greatly improve the lives of millions of Americans.

    This I-Corps project is a new therapy that exercises the upper airway and treats the root cause of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a weak airway that collapses during sleep. The approach is innovative because it identifies unique, directed exercises that can be performed in a voice controlled smartphone game that is both effective and engaging. The therapy builds on existing research, which shows that exercising the upper airway can result in a substantial reduction in snoring and sleep apnea. Backed by strong support from scientific literature, the initial work involved partnering with experts in speech therapy and sleep medicine to identify the most effective therapy to strengthen and tone the upper airway, which addresses the root cause of snoring and sleep apnea. The work has included proof-of-concept experiments using ultrasound imaging of tongue motion during various articulations to ensure the therapy consistently had the intended effect.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a 3-dimensional view of agricultural fields using algorithms applied to remotely sensed imagery to help farmers enhance soil fertility and crop production while also protecting watersheds. From an economic perspective, farmers want to minimize expenditures on nutrients. There is a need by farmers to increase below ground drainage through installation of tiles, perforated plastic pipes, and thus increase production. Tile placement and integrity, coupled with existing data on soil type and characteristics, have a critical impact on the hydrology and fertility of fields, affecting plant growth, the need for fertilizer/nutrients, pesticide and other types of applications. Precise knowledge of a three dimensional view of the land will enable farmers to make appropriate decisions about the application of fertilizers, micro-nutrients, pesticides, etc. to minimize cost, maximize revenue and do as little harm as possible to the ecosystem in which the farm exists. Bringing together data layers of agricultural fields along with information on tile drains will allow the agricultural industry to optimize production through proper placement and repair of tiles while controlling nutrient use and loss.

    This I-Corps project uses remote sensing techniques with aerial imagery to provide information precisely identifying the location of drain tiles buried beneath farm fields. Farmers have expressed that knowledge of the location of tile reduces their costs when tile fail and need repair and also helps when additional tile are added to a field improving drainage. In previous work, it was found that fertilizers applied to agricultural fields will pass through the soil and exit a field through tile drains to the surface water system. This I-Corps project uses remote sensing algorithms to detect tile drains below the soil. The technique utilizes the reflectance of the soil as well as the linear shape expressed on the soil surface that indicates tiles within fields. The information generated through this project is unique and much needed by the agricultural industry to better utilize land in crop production "precision farming".

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a tissue engineering technology that will enable generation of cardiovascular (CV) tissue replacements capable of stretch and recoil, on demand and also on site regenerative repair of blood vessels which are structurally disrupted due to disease. The technology addresses the inability of current tissue engineering approaches to overcome poor ability of adult cells to generate the protein elastin that form the primary component of elastic fibers that provide tissues stretch properties. The proposed innovation is a reparative nanoparticle platform technology comprising antibody-targeted, biodegradable polymer nanoformulations with pro-elastin regenerative and anti-degradative properties. In this project, the technology will be initially validated in the context of treating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), which are localized expansions of the abdominal aorta wall resulting from irreversible elastic matrix breakdown. Through this I-Corps project, the team will assess the commercial viability of this technology, understand key market/customer needs and value propositions, explore partnership opportunities and gain regulatory insight towards generating a realistic business canvas for a commercial startup.

    This I-Corps project provides intellectual merit based on the transformative potential of a novel polymer nanoparticle delivery approach for onsite regenerative repair of disease compromised elastic tissues, which mimic the elastic matrix regenerative effects of stem cell secretions. The technology will first be tested in context of repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), since there are no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for AAAs, and elective surgery and stent grafting on small AAAs have high risk and no treatment benefit. The team will identify a minimum viable product based on regenerative nanoparticles comprising antibody-targeted biodegradable polymer matrices. The pro-elastin regenerative and anti-matrix degradative properties of these nanoparticles are independently provided by both the released active agents (biologic factors identified from adult stem cell derived smooth muscle cells) and chemically functionalized polymer matrix. If successful, the technology will provide realistic prospects to arrest or reverse growth of small AAAs soon after diagnosis, thus reducing need for surgery in these patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the identification of industrial users interested in harnessing olfactory receptor-based biosensors for the rapid detection of chemical and biological targets in the environment or complex aqueous systems.  Unambiguous detection of target chemicals in complex samples has the potential to improve water treatment processes, detect chemical threats in the field, and identify environmental pollutants. Precise detection of biologicals in complex samples has the potential to identify biomarkers for disease diagnosis, reveal contaminated food and water supplies, and alert to airborne pathogens in the environment. The large number of solutions that olfactory-receptor-based sensors have the potential to offer speaks to the large potential commercial impact of this technology.

    This I-Corps project leverages the proteins used in odor detection to generate chemical sensors that fluoresce upon chemical detection. To date, this technology has been used to generate biosensors with flouroescent readout to detect chemicals ranging from biofuels and environmental pollutants to pharmaceutical intermediates and perfumes. Among other applications, the sensors are being used to improve the performance of whole cell and enzyme biocatalysts for the improved production of chemicals.  This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of the innovation to better define the technical requirements of olfactory-based biosensors in commercial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide accurate and timely precipitation forecasts for water resource management during rainfall and hydrological extremes including intense flooding and droughts events. This I-Corps team has developed a unique high resolution weather forecasting model using a high-performance computer framework that employed all available local weather observations and state-of-the-art local doppler radar data to improve local precipitation forecasts on a short-term basis. In conjunction with precipitation forecasts, our system will support water resources related decision-making. A web-based service to provide these pinpoint rainfall forecasts and other related hydrological data products will be available. Operations managers of businesses and government agencies (i.e., water districts, agricultural farms, insurance companies, energy companies) who rely on very accurate and precise rainfall forecasts to make economic-based decisions will be able to have quick access to customized rainfall forecasts and hydrological products at their user-defined locations. During short-term hydrological extremes, these pinpoint accurate rainfall forecasts and products will improve the efficiency and decision-making abilities within the companies and agencies themselves, and it will help them to better communicate their decisions to their end-users and the public.

    This I-Corps project will employ a high-resolution weather forecasting model. It can have a horizontal resolution of 1 km or finer and uses specific 3D-Variational data assimilation methods which incorporate all available real-time weather observations from multiple sources. These input sources include satellite data (e.g., GOES-R), weather station and rain gauge data, quantitative precipitation estimates from local doppler radars, and other global and regional forecasting models (e.g., NOAA?s High Resolution Rapid Refresh and North American Model). The model can be executed separately for any specific region and location of interest to the end-user, can extract pinpoint rainfall forecasts, and can be updated every 3 or 6 hours depending on the circumstance. Other hydrological products available from the project that can also assist in decision support such as drought conditions (e.g., soil moisture and drought severity indices) and water levels of local reservoirs. It is anticipated that the products from this high-resolution modeling and big-data system will provide guidance to support water management and consumption decisions for government agencies and the private sectors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to obtain the benefits available from modernizing legacy processes in the made-to-order design manufacturing industry. Traditionally the mathematical processes used to analyze potential designs are very linear in nature, and do not offer the manufacturer a complete picture of the overall impacts of the non-linear parts of their designs. With the predictive engineering analysis tool developed here, a manufacturing facility can preview the results available from using a particular engineering design prior to the actual manufacturing and testing of the physical parts. Design parameters and environmental conditions can also be inserted into the tool which are then used to better predict the behavior of the part after it is produced. This innovative virtual tool has the potential to be added to the set of existing design and testing tools already being used and let manufacturers predict the success or failure of a part. The impact of this tool would be decreased time to market, eliminating the guesswork now used in certain aspects of a design and saving valuable physical resources.

    This I-Corps project defines an innovative scalable software tool that is capable of virtually predicting the success or failure of an engineering design prior to production. The technique is based on the mathematical modeling of the coordinated behaviors of biological system. This allows the tool to quickly search and intelligently predict the best solution sets to a multi-objective problem in a given design space. This project employs these innovative bio-inspired techniques to develop algorithms which are applied to engineering designs to produce an ideal set of solutions based on user defined objectives. Bio-inspired algorithms have been shown to improve upon current standard rigid mathematical techniques. This project provides the flexibility to implement an approach that is able to search the entire problem space at once therefore giving better visibility to all of the possible solutions. Since no particular parameter in isolation impacts the outcome of the algorithm, the user is presented with the opportunity to shift the input parameters and rerun the optimization.  Further this I-Corps project attempts to explore and define the input parameters for a variety of industries, and assist the end user in coming up with better designs for their products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the application of high performance catalysts for use in energy conversion/storage devices such as fuel cells and batteries. Successful commercialization will considerably advance nano-manufacturing in electrochemical energy conversion/storage and have a positive impact on a number of clean energy technologies. Typical customers for the proposed innovation include a broad spectrum of high-tech industries which will potentially benefit from commercialization of this technology. Some examples include fuel cell manufacturers, automotive industry, consumer electronics and energy storage companies. Superior performance of novel amorphous catalysts compared to state of the art suggests that this technology might be attractive core strength for a new company. As such, this I-Corps program will seek to understand whether a market opportunity exists around application of this technology and any potential spin-out company.

    This I-Corps project is focused on addressing catalyst performance bottlenecks in energy conversion/storage technologies such as fuel cells and batteries. This will be achieved by replacing state of the art nanoparticle catalysts with novel amorphous metallic alloys. Metallic glasses are fully amorphous multi-component alloys with unique combination of properties and processing ability. They can be produced in a wide range of compositions that are not available in crystalline form and therefore their electronic and catalytic characteristics can be engineered to achieve superior performance. A self-supporting architecture will be used for these novel amorphous catalysts, which prevent the dissolution of support material and significantly improve durability. The success of this project will lead to commercialization of highly-efficient and low-cost catalytic materials for electrochemical energy devices. It will pave the way for new clean energy technology ventures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the improvement of patient outcomes in long-term care facilities. As America ages, the need for effective care of the elderly becomes more pressing, with more than 50000 facilities caring for more than 3.5 million patients at any one time. This I-Corps project can lead to the adoption of the new decision-making technology that incorporates unique predictive algorithms to help management teams in long-term care facilities maximize the information from their currently collected safety and clinical data. By adopting this new technology, management teams will be able to predict where there may be deficiencies, prioritize key drivers associated with specific patient outcomes, and prevent adverse events. The new technology can be adopted as a cloud based information and data delivery system.

    This I-Corps project supports customer discovery of an innovation using a unique predictive modeling algorithm that identifies key drivers of specific patient outcomes and produces meaningful benchmarks for each driver that management teams can use to guide quality improvement efforts. The algorithm determines where a facility is on each key driver in relation to each benchmark and produces a prioritized list of actions needed for continuous improvement. The algorithm provides a stable framework for improvement that is not sensitive to data imperfections and does not allow those imperfections to distract decision-making from real priorities. The algorithm was developed based on extensive research and practice of applying the Rasch model and objective standard-setting process in different settings, including health, psychology and transportation. The most extensive of these applications were the development of rigorous risk and defensibility assessments for long-term care facilities and hospitals, and the development of differentiation algorithms for passenger experience in the airline industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is related to reductions in inspection and maintenance costs of commercial and military aircraft. As the average age of existing aircraft is extending beyond the design life, fatigue cracks are a major issue that requires close monitoring to ensure continued airworthiness. Extensive and time consuming manual non-destructive inspection programs have been implemented to monitor and insure the safety and structural integrity of the aircraft. The Wavenumber Spiral Frequency-Steerable Acoustic Transducer (WS-FSAT) is a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) sensor that enables inspection of in hard-to-reach areas within an aircraft or other asset, where significant structural risk is present, and promises to enable remote inspection of critical structures without disassembly. The technology has the advantage of inherent directional sensing capabilities over relatively wide areas, which translates to lower size, weight and installation costs. Potential benefits include the reduction of the time and cost of inspections, and of the associated aircraft downtime, and of structural integrity risks through more frequent monitoring of structural risk areas. The proposed I-Corp program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities of the technology within the aerospace industry and its broader applicability for inspection and monitoring of structural components.

    This I-Corps project explores application and market opportunities for the Wavenumber Spiral Frequency-Steerable Acoustic Transducer (WS-FSAT). The WS-FSAT is a novel ultrasonic transducer that enables in-situ, nondestructive inspection of aircraft structures to detect defects that impact structural integrity and safety. WS-FSATs have inherent directional capabilities with the ability to detect, locate and characterize structural defects with significantly lower hardware and signal processing complexity than other approaches. The WS-FSAT maps the direction of wave sensing to a specific frequency component in the spectrum of the received signal, which greatly facilitates the identification and localization of damage. These directional capabilities rely on the design of the electrodes on a sensing substrate that performs the transduction of mechanical strains associated with waves propagating in the structure to an electrical signal. Such design process is at the core of the technology, and is suitable to meet the needs of inspection of complex structural components.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercial applicability of novel image analysis and feature detection algorithms and dynamic path planning algorithms. The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project include creation and commercialization of a software product for monitoring agricultural and natural landscapes using unmanned aerial systems. The benefits of commercialization of this advanced technology are expected to include improvement in the profitability and productivity of major food crops, increase in food security, and enable long-term sustainability of the nation's agronomic and natural resources. The proposed customer-interaction efforts will also lead to increased technical capacity among stakeholders in US agriculture and natural resource management sectors as they will involve intensive interaction between the proposing team with scientific and technical expertise, and the stakeholders in the target customer segments who have the necessary on-the-ground experience.

    This I-Corps project's image analysis and feature detection algorithms and dynamic path planning algorithms have been developed for rapid and computationally efficient detection of anomalous areas in visual spectrum images using mobile processors. The dynamic path planning algorithms enable automatic mid-flight modification of drone flight plans based on analysis of incoming data from drone-based sensors. Together these algorithms enable autonomous capture of high-value information and immediate delivery of actionable insights from drone missions. This technology will be a significant improvement on existing commercial offerings for drone-based monitoring, which involve high labor and equipment costs, require cloud-connectivity for data analysis, and are difficult to use and understand. By contrast, the fundamentally new workflow paradigms and innovative technical advances that will be examined here will enable rapid delivery of actionable insights about potential problems in remote environments using consumer level drones and visual spectrum cameras.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a genetically engineered strain of copepods (small aquatic crustaceans) that hyperproduce the natural red carotenoid, astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is an especially economically important pigment used in the aquaculture, nutraceutical, and cosmetic industries. Astaxanthin can be made synthetically but there is increasing demand for naturally sourced astaxanthin. Currently, the market value of natural astaxanthin for aquaculture feed is approximately $2000/kg and the nutraceutical market value for natural astaxanthin is alomst $15,000/kg. Recent estimates of the global astaxanthin market size are at more than 250 tons in 2014 and a projected compound annual growth rate of over 7% from 2016 to 2023. This technology provides two main benefits to customers: a natural source of astaxanthin at a potentially lower cost than current sources and potential for future engineering to further increase astaxanthin production and reduce production costs.

    This I-Corps project will explore the market potential of genetically engineered lineages of the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus that produced up to 80% more natural astaxanthin than wild copepods. Copepods are tiny crustaceans related to shrimp and are natural component of marine fish diets. This technology is an improvement over the current sources because copepods potentially produce more red pigment at a lower production cost, and it has been demonstrated that genetic engineering for increased astaxanthin production is feasible. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunities for the technology through customer discovery interviews that will result in customer feedback that provides a better understanding of the requirements for commercialization. Additionally, this project has the potential to lead to significant progress in research on natural pigment production for commercial applications.

Performance evaluation plays a significant role in any setting where the quality of performing specific actions is important to the desired outcome. Businesses and organizations use evaluation to assess employee/individual performance. Performance evaluations are commonly a written assessment completed by a superior or expert at the time the actions occur. This I-Corps project will support the discovery and understanding of how this video-based technology could lead to improvements in existing evaluation practices. The technology has the potential to advance the use of video data for evaluation, further the design and development of expert frameworks for evaluation and evolve training development for businesses and organizations.

    This I-Corps project will explore the potential demand for a video-based performance evaluation tool. This technology allows a user to observe and evaluate an individual's performance using recorded video. The video is compared to best practices resulting in an evaluation of the performance. The results are used to identify and target intervention/training with the goal of improved performance. The innovation is designed to improve performance evaluation. The effects of this technology have been demonstrated through research and development of a performance evaluation instrument for teacher education that successfully evaluates performance and informs the development of interventions for further improvement.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide accurate measurements of solar radiation and sky condition for weather, climate, air quality, and solar energy applications. The I-Corps project enables accurate monitoring and understanding of the inherent variability of solar radiation due to cloud cover, aerosol loading, and other atmospheric gases that are essential for determining solar energy generation.  The technology and associated data analytics enable solar energy producers, developers, distributors, and researchers to improve solar energy prediction, to enhance solar panel efficiency, to reduce operation and maintenance costs, and to potnetially increase the penetration of solar energy into the power grid.

    This I-Corps project will enable customer discovery for a core technology which integrates a multi-channel radiometer and a sky imager into a shadowband scanning smart system. This smart system measures spectral and angular solar radiation distribution and meteorological parameters for monitoring solar radiation and weather conditions. It also combines communication, computing, remote sensing, and advanced analytics, and responds to feedback from the prevailing environment to deliver improved accuracy and performance. Thereby, it represents a multi-fold improvement over existing methods/systems. This enables more accurate retrievals of optical properties of aerosol, cloud, ozone, and water vapor in the atmosphere. The proposed activities will advance science and technology in weather, climate, air quality, and solar energy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will derive from a new 3D printing technology that can address critical needs in small volume/smart devices by providing products with increased strength-to-weight ratios, integrated materials that enable designed functionality, and a high degree of feature customization. 3D printed components with optimal shape and functional properties have a multitude of potential applications in the automotive, aerospace, environmental monitoring and medical fields. With the potential introduction of commercial drone applications, this technology will meet an increased need for flexible payload carrier fabrication techniques that can be customized for payload specific weight, strength, and design requirements. Additionally, the technology described in this project will provide an alternative fabrication approach for customized assistive devices that has the potential to decrease production time, lower waste and energy consumption, decrease costs, improve assistive device customization and user performance. Lastly, the ability to embed novel capabilities such as monitoring acceleration or temperature and pressure at the skin interface into these devices aligns with a growing societal interest in wearable sensors.

    This I-Corps project will identify the key value propositions of a novel 3D printing technology for targeted customers and quantify the market value for devices fabricated with this technology across several application areas. Key strategic partners and major competitors within the general areas that align with this technology will be investigated. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the new knowledge that will be obtained regarding application driven needs for 3D printing of fiber reinforced polymers that enable customized fabrication of smart, functional devices. This advanced 3D printing technology reconfigures and extends the functionality of a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing approach to enable 3D printing of continuous fiber composite materials along curvatures on multiple planes, including overhanging features. Preliminary results from this technology have demonstrated the first example of out-of-plane 3D printing at the meso-scale. The new knowledge resulting from this I-Corps project will inform and direct further technological advancements towards the development of a printing system targeted for specific application needs in size, strength, resolution, and material diversity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve food safety and reduce the incidents caused by food-borne pathogens. This project will: (i) help ensure that the U.S. food supply is safe by providing food facilities and consumers with effective diagnostics tools, (ii) advance the commercialization of a portable food monitor, and (iii) provide timely protection against consumer microbial hazards and eliminate unnecessary product recalls. This sensor will directly benefit society by providing a new diagnostic tool that may empower users to take control of the safety of the food they consume.

    This I-Corps project will further develop a biosensor technology that functions via a synergy between conducting poly (amic) acid (PAA) and metal nanoparticles.   Nano-sized nanoparticles have a high electron affinity and can strip off electrons from the surrounding PAA matrix. The technology is designed to detect the 'notorious five' pathogens namely, Salmonella, E. coli, Norovirus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria (Sensal) all within 5 minutes at 5 colonies forming unit/mL or less. Unlike enzymes, DNA or lipids, the recognition ligands are more robust and specific for the pathogen. The biosensor device is similar to a glucose strip. When samples containing the pathogens are exposed to the strip, concentration-dependent recognition results in visible color change on the membrane strips indicating positive results for E.coli or other pathogens.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this I-Corps project is to provide a solution for prioritizing investment in management and retrofit of critical infrastructure. Critical infrastructure systems include water, power, transportation, communication, and fuel networks. These systems are interconnected and interdependent. They are also aging and subject to increasing hazards, with billions of dollars of investment required to modernize, repair, and retrofit these systems. This project will identify the critical components of these systems such that the resources invested have the greatest impact in mitigating the effects of natural disasters and human attacks on infrastructure, including minimizing the potential for cascading failures across multiple systems given an event. It will improve the performance of these systems for both daily operations and disaster response to provide critical infrastructure services to communities.

    This I-Corps project is based on previous work in interdependent infrastructure systems modeling. Specifically, a novel probabilistic framework has been developed to model the complex interdependencies between critical infrastructures. This captures the effects of events, outages, and component failures across multiple systems. It includes uncertainty modeling to perform risk and vulnerability analyses. The I-Corps technology is a generalized software tool based on this research that accounts for interdependencies, is developed for both normal operations and unexpected disruptions, and is suitable to any infrastructure system. Compared to current systems that rely on experience or subjective judgment, and only consider individual systems, the technology enables infrastructure owners and system managers to consider impacts across systems to optimize asset management, repair, and recovery decisions to improve infrastructure performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes biomedical interventions which harness precise microwave heating patterns from thin needle- and/or catheter-based applicators. Use examples may include image-guided thermal ablation of localized tumors via percutaneous, endoluminal, and endoscopic approaches; localized thermally-mediated drug delivery; and electrosurgical devices for thermal destruction of benign targets. The microwave applicators described in this proposal afford, for the first time, directional control of energy deposition from within thin catheter/needle-based structures. They will enable precise heating of targets in proximity to critical structures, thereby considerably expanding the range of patients that can be treated with low-cost thermal ablation procedures. Furthermore, the proposed microwave applicators may have application to microwave-assisted chemical reactions for materials processing.

    This I-Corps project will be focused on customer discovery to identify and understand customer needs in the field of localized microwave heating for biomedical and other applications.  The microwave applicators with directional control of energy deposition have been extensively evaluated with biophysical simulations and benchtop experiments in excised tissue, as well as with preliminary in vivo animal experiments. Proof-of-concept devices have also been integrated with magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate feasibility for image-guided procedures. This I-Corps project will train the team on identifying potential customers, understanding their needs, and developing technologies to address these needs. This experience will guide the team?s ongoing and future technology developments efforts so they are grounded in practical needs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a privacy design framework that leverages contextual integrity (CI) principles combined with formal logic methods to enable organizations and end users to build new forms of privacy aware information systems. The privacy design framework addresses a fundamental privacy gap in existing information systems in large organizations between system level privacy guarantees and privacy expectations of end users. It is envisioned that the privacy design framework will be a service that enables ordinary users to express complex privacy rules in an organization based on CI principles.  It will also leverage formal logic methods to convert contextual integrity rules to logic programs that verify the privacy properties of information flows within the organization. This privacy framework aims to ease the development of new privacy aware information systems that support the full spectrum of stakeholders in organizations including end users, administrators, system designers and regulators. It can enable greater transparency for regulators, data protection authorities, administrators and end users.

    This I-Corps project will evaluate privacy as a service design framework using the principles of contextual integrity theory that offers system designers the tools to clearly articulate, design and implement privacy policies in large scale information systems, where the privacy policies clearly match the privacy expectations of end users. The privacy framework makes three fundamental research contributions:  (i) The framework uses the theory of contextual integrity to formalize informational norms as logical rules that constitute a privacy logic of the system, thereby providing the ability to reason about privacy in complex information systems; (ii) The framework is modular and domain agnostic where it decouples specification of privacy logic from the enforcement of privacy checks on information flows within the system while requiring minimal modifications to the underlying system; (iii) The system leverages formal logic methods to ensure the correctness of privacy policy specifications and ensures that information exchange within the system strictly follows the established privacy norms of a given context.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project rests in the creation of a new category of how networking is offered.  Rather than offered as a static collection of physical appliances to be managed by a company's IT staff, this project aims to provide network processing as a service, and in turn reduce capital costs (through more efficient use of resources), as well as operational costs (by simplifying management).  In effect, it seeks to do for networking what cloud computing did for computing.  Target markets include traditional enterprise networks, which can replace their physical network devices with this service to save money and simplify management, and Cloud and telecom service providers which could offer the service as an add-on feature to their customers in order to increase revenue.  As more devices come online, as more traffic traverses a network, and as networks further become more integral to business operations, the needs for more reliable and efficient networks will likewise increase.

    This I-Corps project explores the market for a new approach to network functions virtualization, where network functions are disaggregated into separate processing and state storage components.  Experiments have shown seamless scalability, disruptionless failure management, and processing rates in line with other software solutions.  The aim of this I-Corps project is to interview a large number of potential customers to understand their current and future needs, challenges, and operations. With this, the commercial viability and value proposition of the 'stateless' network functions technology will be better understood.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to apply the compelling features "heterogeneity profiling" and "high spatial and temporal resolution" of the newly developed all-in-one milli-electrode array to solve the urgent need of real-time monitoring in a broad spectrum of biochemical reaction systems ranging from water/wastewater treatment units to food/pharmaceutical biofermentors. The commercialization of milli-electrode array as a new class of real-time in situ profiling technology will have substantial impacts on biochemical system market, specifically to obtain "head-to-toe" profiling and visualize biochemical heterogeneity, which will fundamentally change system monitoring and control, and optimize system operation at the lowest capital cost. The I-Corps funding will enable the team to establish a better understanding of biochemical system market and the needs of consumers, and thereby, maximizing the commercial success of this novel sensing technology.

    This I-Corps project aims at determining the commercial potential of milli-electrode array technology and exploring the customer needs. Currently, all the biochemical waste treatment (e.g. municipal wastewater, food waste, and industrial wastewater) systems are monitored using single point probes without obtaining a whole picture of system heterogeneity. With over 15,000 wastewater treatment plants to be retrofitted and 11,000 anaerobic digestion systems to be developed in the US by 2035, durable inexpensive rapid sensing device capable of simultaneously monitoring multiple parameters is of great significance to achieve high treatment efficiency and operational stability at lowest energy consumption, and thus yielding enormous social, environmental, and economic value.  The innovation of the core milli-electrode array technology lies in precise patterning multiple types of mm-sized electrodes on a single flexible film and the capability of real-time profiling multiple biochemical parameters at high spatiotemporal resolution. The state of the art milli-electrode array possesses breakthrough properties compared to existing single-point sensors: sturdy configuration with long lifetime, simple measurement procedure, low cost, highly durable material, easy deployment and replacement, and profiling multiple parameters spatiotemporally.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to leverage advanced computational and machine learning technology to assist psychiatric hospitals in stratifying patients' readmission risk, optimization of post-discharge interventions and promotion of wellness. Healthcare reforms in the United States have emphasized provision of value-based healthcare services as opposed to the traditional 'fee-for-service' approach. A major outcome to be used by regulatory bodies and payers is patient readmission - interpreted as a proxy measure of quality of care provided during hospitalization. Therefore, psychiatric facilities will increasingly be required to pay special attention to patients with a high likelihood of readmission after discharge. This will be a significant departure from the traditional approach and require novel analytical tools able to proactively guide interventions. Computational and machine learning technologies can assist healthcare providers in stratifying patients' readmission risks, optimize post-discharge interventions and resource allocation - translating into better patient outcomes.

    This I-Corps project is focused on exploring a commercialization opportunity for a computational and machine learning 'software as a service' platform that analyzes clinical informatics data from patients hospitalized in an inpatient psychiatric facility to predict post-discharge risk of readmission. In addition, the proposed platform consists of an advanced analytics engine that recommends available post-discharge intervention services and community resources to enhance the continuity of care. This platform will leverage on historical electronic health records data and a curated database of available community healthcare and social resources. It will predict readmission risk and optimize patient post-discharge interventions. The I-Corps program will allow the team to understand the customer workflow and potential for product-market fit.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in addressing the needs of the rapidly developing materials science, optics, photonics, and telecommunications industries. Collectively, optics and photonics touch almost every part of modern life. Further development in these industries requires efficient design and utilization of ever-more-complex materials and interfaces. The proposed project has potential to address this fundamental need by enabling quick and efficient characterization, design, and optimization of complex structured media. With new materials and interfaces at hand, optics and photonics companies will have potential to, for example, drastically improve resolution of microscopes, improve the performance of radars and telescopes, develop new sources of light (lasers, LEDs), new routers of light (filters, reflectors, diffusers), new absorbers and detectors of electromagnetic radiation (CCDs, solar cells), as well as new active optical components (such as touch screens and displays).

    The intellectual merit of this I-Corps project is aimed at understanding the commercialization potential of a powerful proprietary software package. The versatile software allows for rapid and accurate calculation of transmission, reflection, absorption, and scattering of complex periodic composite structured materials and interfaces such as diffractive gratings, photonic crystals, and metamaterials. In the recent fundamental science studies the developed codes were used to (i) design and optimize new high resolution and high-speed microscopy that can be potentially used to characterize nanoparticles and viruses, (ii) understand optical response of new structured interfaces that have ultra-high transparency combined with conductance comparable to that of copper wires, (iii) new diffractive structures for steering and guiding of light. The research has demonstrated that there exists a large class of materials and interfaces, where the software package is orders-of-magnitude faster and more accurate than commercially available finite-elements and finite-difference software.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve upon orthopedic medical device design. The medical device market for orthopedics is currently a multi-billion dollar industry. Back pain is the second most common complaint heard by primary care physicians, while over 500,000 knee-ligament reconstructions are performed in the US annually. The total cost of back pain has been estimated to cost the United States between $100 and $200 billion annually. These costs have been calculated from the direct costs of surgery and the indirect costs of lost wages, reduced productivity, and cost of care. This project will challenge the standard of care for orthopedics by integrating a new class of smart and novel polymer materials into medical device design.

    This I-Corps project focuses on translating liquid-crystal elastomers (LCEs) into the medical device marketplace. LCEs are a class of stimuli-sensitive "smart" materials that display remarkable mechanical properties and can actively respond to a stimulus; however, these materials have traditionally been difficult to manufacture in a practical and scalable way. This I-Corps project will utilize a newly discovered manufacturing method to produce main-chain LCEs using a thiol-acrylate reaction. This project aims to exploit the unique properties of these materials, such as thermo-reversible actuation, soft elasticity, or damping, to unlock new functionalities in medical device design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around the need to reduce societal healthcare costs and to improve the quality of disease diagnostics. Unfortunately for many patients needing diagnostic procedures for cancer and other disease evaluation, preliminary testing does not reveal accurate results in a timely manner. This is a particular problem for cancers such as prostate and breast and non-oncologic diseases of the kidney and liver where imaging fresh tissue is an important component of the evaluation process. Limitations of fresh tissue evaluation ultimately result in unnecessary repeat procedures for patients because current protocols involve tissue destruction and long processing times to reveal a diagnosis. Faster, more accurate clinical imaging techniques can potentially decrease overall healthcare costs and the burden of many invasive procedures by reducing unnecessary repeat diagnostic procedures. Furthermore, rapid clinical imaging techniques can lessen the cost of personalized medicine by offering a more simplistic approach from a data collection and storage standpoint. Considering expanded applications of rapid imaging technology outside of healthcare, novel techniques can improve industrial screening of materials and offer efficient solutions for precision measurement of products.

    This I-Corps project aims to further develop a rapid imaging technique for commercialization in healthcare or other industry. The technology represents a novel application of structured illumination microscopy (SIM), which utilizes patterned light and a mathematical algorithm to eliminate out of focus areas in the resulting images. Imaging with SIM produces high-resolution images of fluorescent objects such as cells in biological tissue, inorganic chemicals, or fibers in forensics. The SIM system is able to image a relatively large area with a variety of fast-acting stains, representing a speed breakthrough in the field of fluorescence microscopy. The speed advantage of SIM inspired preliminary research focused on point-of-procedure fresh tissue imaging for cancer evaluation. Pilot clinical studies evaluating prostate and kidney biopsy tissue have demonstrated that SIM is an accurate tool for identifying cancer. Importantly, fresh tissue with minimal processing can be captured with SIM to produce pathology-relevant digital images within minutes of tissue removal. Further validation of SIM for cancer diagnostics has been conducted on larger specimens including surgically removed prostates and partial kidneys. While preliminary data has shown the potential for point-of-procedure cancer evaluation, this I-Corps project will also explore applications in other industries such as chemistry and forensics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be realized first in pharmaceutical manufacturing where powder blends are required to prepare tablets. The new sampler will bring products to market in less time providing benefit to patients and pharmaceutical companies. The proposed device (sampler) will potentially protect employees in pharmaceutical plants from exposure to potentially toxic drugs. It will potentially be useful across a wide variety of industries and be suitable for powder blends such as vitamins, nutraceuticals, powdered milk, and other food products. The sampler will improve quality control and potentially lead to representative sampling in quality control, thereby reducing risk to customers and patients.

    This I-Corps project will define the essential components and features for sampling powders in pharma and food manufacturing applications. The current technology does not provide representative samples from these important commercial products. Current approaches use a spear (thief sampler) to obtain samples from only a few pre-selected locations within the manufacturing equipment, and will typically fail to detect variations or problems outside of these locations. The spear also often alters the composition of the material that is sampled, providing inaccurate measurements of the composition of the powdered product.  The new device will be based on best practices first established within the mining industry, which have not been adapted to the pharmaceutical and food industries due to lack of suitable sampling devices. The goal of the I-corps project is to develop powder sampling methods to improve the quality of powder based products, and avoid unnecessary product loss due to poor sampling practices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is driven by the development of a new plant-based surfactant technology, which has the potential to transform the agrochemicals, oil recovery, and detergents/personal care market toward health friendly and environmentally safe chemicals. A major limitation of existing plant-based surfactant technologies is that they have limited performance compared petrochemical-based surfactants. This entirely bio-renewable surfactant technology provides a competitive advantage in that can be customized toward a specific market, potentially outperform all existing surfactants, and that it can potentially replace the function of numerous existing chemicals in a particular formulation, providing substantially more value and simplifying complex products.

    This I-Corps project aims to engage in targeted customer discovery research to evaluate the commercial impact of the proposed surfactant technology and to align the technical performance of the tunable technology with a distinct competitive advantage in the target market. This I-Corps project is based on the development of a patented process technology for combining plant-based natural oils and sugars into highly functional surfactants that outperform all other surfactants. Technical results from preliminary research have demonstrated the customizable nature of the technology toward specific markets, providing strong multi-functional performance to replace the need for complex blends of chemicals.

    pathways;  \n2) Draw upon CSUPERBs existing network of alumni, industry experts
    and campus-based entrepreneurship resources, to offer tailored advice for science-based
    ventures; \n3) Tailor a curriculum for biological sciences entrepreneurs to explore
    venture ideas, assess the maturity of their technology, and map out development
    milestones; and  \n4) Organize recurring, regional meetings co-hosted by industry
    associations and partner organizations for curious academic biological sciences
    entrepreneurs. \n\nThe I-Corps Biological Sciences Site will nurture CSU researchers
    so that they gain confidence in their entrepreneurial abilities, greater understanding

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to build a recommender system which assigns values to artifacts and will also provide stakeholders in unregulated markets with better information for reducing risk and improving trust. The Internet and technology have entirely changed the nature of interactions between every business sector, including the art industry, by creating a digital marketplace and introducing additional issues for markets regulation. The proposed recommender system can be used to predict value of investment, to provide an objective value of goods in legal proceedings, insurance cases, and banks as a collateral toll.  This supports financial stability of markets through better decision making and improves the trust of stakeholders in their investments. It also helps to maintain control of the commercial aspects of work. For example, the acquisitions departments of museums would be served by knowing a real value for the artifacts they buy.

    This I-Corps project is focused on building a recommender system for assigning values to artworks using existing datasets and deep knowledge. Art markets are often misvalued which makes the classical approach to building recommender systems rather difficult due to unreliable datasets. Classifiers trained on these datasets often assign inflated prices. A crowd approach is used here which is expected to give more reliable results. Personalization for this class of problems can be achieved by assigning semantic distance.  The project extends the group of classical features by adding semantic features from mining comments given by users, and, for example, from artist biographies, and images of paintings. For each cluster of semantically similar artists, a personalized recommender system for art evaluation is built. Wisdom of the crowd will be used to assign a specific value to an art piece.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce loss of life in disaster rescue on rough terrain. Disaster rescue can endanger the lives of both the victims and the first responders, with the Red Cross reporting 400 deaths in disaster rescue in the past 20 years.  More than half of the casualties were volunteers who entered unchartered risky environments. Future deaths could be prevented by utilizing semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. By dropping the proposed shape-shifting robots from aerial vehicles, these mobile robots could explore previously difficult to reach areas for effective emergency response. This proposed technology will also have broader impact in use for scientific monitoring and surveillance as well as for educational applications for K-12 students, teachers, parents, roboticists and hobbyists. With the potential to have large impact (with over 3 million potential teachers; 1 million teachers alone in secondary schools), robot kits could be marketed for educational applications, especially for schools trying to meet the Next Generation Science Standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to enable more efficient production of heat exchanger-like components (featuring complex internal geometries) that are currently time intensive and costly to manufacture. The project has its origins in fully 3D printed rocket engine research. The project provides a solution for the mass production of liquid rocket engines so that launching infrastructure to space will happen more frequently. In order to meet the backlog from rising demand, the space industry needs a more rapid rate of rocket launches to deliver infrastructure (such as satellites) into space. Engine manufacturing technology has stifled launch vehicle production, which in turn has restricted the ability to meet demand in the launch vehicle industries. Providing a rapid production technique to fabricate large quantities of high efficiency rocket engines will allow launch costs and production time to be reduced significantly. The commercial impact of rapidly producing complex heat exchangers will also allow industries to iterate on designs and decrease total cost for production units in industrial applications. Manufacturing high efficiency heat exchangers allows for decreased component size production which can decrease total mass for complex systems. Industrial applications for high efficiency heat exchangers exist in the jet engine manufacturing, thermal power plant, and large-scale refinery manufacturing industries.

    This I-Corps project improves upon conventional engine manufacturing methods and even new additive manufacturing methods by using a proprietary technology to quickly produce fully regeneratively cooled engines. The technology is a physical fabrication and assembly process for the hardest-to-manufacture engine components that can decrease production time by 90% and cost by 80%, respectively, compared to current methods. Two fully 3D printed rocket engines have been fabricated and tested. One of the 3D printed rocket engines was launched on a sounding rocket e created to serve as a flight article and validate the work to date. The third-generation engine will improve upon conventional 3D metal printing deficiencies of high porosity, numerous post processing steps, and scalability in both volume and size production. The team will work to address and account for the deficiencies with conventional 3D metal printing to allow for mass production of complex heat exchangers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will benefit epileptic patients by improving diagnostic systems for doctors, freeing them from manual scanning of continuous electroencephalogram results. This is expected to bring about significant reduction of cost in health care and enable novel commercial applications of monitoring of epileptic patients.  The nonlinear analysis technique applied in this project has the potential to open up new applications in neuroscience and may prove to be essential in recognizing how and why seizures occur as well as other neurological disorders. The high resolution of the approach also indicates a potential in identifying seizure precursors, which would better assess seizure susceptibility and ultimately lead to seizure suppression through external intervention.

    This I-Corps project further develops a reliable and automated seizure detection mechanism which will potentially aid medical practitioners and patients with epilepsy. The established practice for patients suspected of epilepsy is a manual process, highly labor-intensive, and prone to human error. The technology developed here addresses these problems by utilizing techniques from chaotic systems and nonlinear measures that more accurately describe brain activity and yield significantly more accurate results in seizure detection using EEG data compared to standard linear measures. It combines state-of-the-art solutions from both algorithms and computing hardware. At the heart of the method, there is a recently developed algorithm for the estimation of Lyapunov exponents, a measure of chaoticity, that was shown to provide unparalleled resolution and noise immunity.  This method is computationally expensive. To adhere to the real-time constraints of the application, the project employs parallelizable platforms such as multi-core CPUs/GPUs. Furthermore, complete automation will be achieved by testing out a number of shape detection algorithms through the use of neural networks and wavelet matching. The method has been tested on extensive records from animal models and some human data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve food safety and security of hand harvested food crops through individualized geo-spatial data collection. Much like highway cameras have an ability to tell the status of traffic on a given freeway are vastly improved through the individualized data of each driver and their phones, hand harvested food can benefit from improving traceability and transparency from block level data to single points of harvest, recalling intersecting mapping data. Geo-specific data can also enable better land productivity measurement over textual block data.  Individualized, personally owned, data enables workers to have portability of information, building a resume of dependability and performance.  In addition, it becomes an integral component of a viable transparency scheme.  The project will potentially improve the economic standing of harvesters, improve the capability of farmers to better understand their workforce and land, assist marketers with improved data to insure against breakdowns in food safety, and enable consumers transparency without added steps to the system.

    This I-Corps project further develops improved data collection methods in high-value hand-picked specialty crops. The data in question is a precise record of who harvests what, where and when.  Contextual data (quality, irrigation/fertilization data, cultural practice maps, etc.) are added and visualized for farmers.  The project will test the relationship of data sets toward improved decision skills; better management depends on better measurement.  It provides a better understanding of inhomogeneities in space and time.  Addressing these inhomogeneities leading to investigation and reductions of variance.  The system will enables comprehension of bottlenecks and workflow problems in labor process and allow dynamic and real-time decisions.  The system will also allow quantitative approaches toward finding optimal decisions in several parts of the system and provide a platform for decentralized decision-making based on common data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the product-market fit  for a conceptual model-based math intelligent tutors (COMMIT) for teaching students with learning disabilities or difficulties in mathematics.  The technology will help overcome a current impediment for these students' success in mathematics, the shortage of response to intervention curriculum materials and service providers.  The COMMIT products will potentially address a practical issue in today's inclusive elementary classrooms: the need to deliver individualized and effective intervention programs to those students who are not responsive to or are struggling with mathematics content in their regular classrooms. The COMMIT products will also promote the implementation of evidence-based practice and translation of research into practice. Because the COMMITs emphasize a conceptual model-based problem solving approach that orients students' attention to deep problem structure, it is expected that this program can also be used to improve mathematical learning of elementary students more broadly.

    This I-Corps project, conceptual model-based math intelligent tutors (COMMIT), represents a shift from traditional mathematics problem-solving instruction, which focuses on the choice of operation for solution, to a model-based problem-solving approach that emphasizes an understanding and representation of mathematical relations in algebraic equations and therefore facilitates generalized problem solving skills. The COMMITs incorporate a constructivist view of mathematics learning so that the reasoning behind mathematics is explicit to the students. In other words, students will be able to make sense of what they are doing with mathematical models and abstract symbols. The COMMIT project will demonstrate how intelligent tutors will work with teachers in synergy and provide personalized curriculum recommendations that are based on a dynamic assessment of individual student's learning profile. COMMITs help build fundamental mathematical ideas that are essential to enabling struggling students to understand mathematics at a conceptual or abstract level.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide software, training, and services relating to measuring, tracking, and understanding interpersonal physiological interdependence - a biological measure of social engagement.  Though this research area dates back more than half a century, new technologies including wearable physiological monitors, advanced statistical modeling, and smart phone computing have sparked rapid advancements in its potential application. Consistent findings in the scientific literature indicate that interdependence between people's autonomic nervous systems are indicative of psychosocial processes including engagement, empathy, emotional contagion, leadership, and teamwork. Such physiological interdependencies have been observed across a wide range of populations, contexts, and conditions, using different physiological measures and analytical approaches. Such findings allow interpretive conclusions to be made about social interactions using statistical models of relationships between peoples' physiology. This technology will potentially benefit treatment providers who deliver psychotherapy to mental health and intellectual/developmental disability segments of the behavioral health market, and to clinical trials researchers in the pharmaceutical industry evaluating medications with indications for mental health.

    This I-Corps project further develops approaches in the rapidly expanding area of social psychophysiological research, interpersonal physiology. Phenomenologically, when people interact, interdependencies between their physiological activities reflect their social relationships. These physiological relationships occur at dyadic and group levels. Due to the interpretability of physiological relationships, conclusions regarding social dynamics can be made through physiology. Through this method, continuously shifting interpersonal dynamics can be observed and quantified in ways that allow anyone to understand when, how, and to what degree one person is impacting another. Individuals or industries seeking to gain increased understanding of their own or others interpersonal engagement could benefit from this biologically-based objective method of assessment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create wireless chargers, which are necessary for the eventual adoption of programmatic/semi-autonomous commercial drone usage. These chargers directly address the significant challenge of drone battery capacity, and serve in the same capacity as gas stations do for cars and trucks. Given the rapidly growing interest in the use of drone technology for historically dangerous and onerous activities such as oil & gas, telecom, and utility asset inspection, the platform could become a key part of the eventual drone infrastructure. Wireless charging is inherently a clean method of power transmission; by enabling cleaner technologies, such as electric multicopters, rather than fuel-powered fixed-wing drones, our platform will be a major accelerant for energy savings in the future.

    This I-Corps project successfully demonstrates long-distance wireless power transfer using Radio Frequency (RF) beamforming. A working prototype with multiple antennas and an energy harvester that exhibits successful long-range wireless charging using RF beamforming has been developed using software defined radios. In order to scale the system to deliver wireless power to drones, a massive MIMO transmitter with multiple antennas is proposed. Each antenna's signal constructively interferes with the others, providing an efficiently beamformed power gain in the direction of the drone, which is retrofitted with a rectifier to convert the electromagnetic energy to usable direct current to charge the battery. Provided the drones are within line-of-sight, the chargers can deliver power wirelessly from up to 40 to 60 feet, also assuming proper compensation of the mutual coupling from the antennas. The transmitter and receiver architectures at the scale of drones have been fully designed, and require further implementation of the digital signal processing software, system parallelization, and high-power rectifying circuit to realize the full beamforming solution.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps project includes exploring the commercial potential of a novel solar cell for simultaneous electricity storage and generation. The technology may also enable long-term sustainability of the nation's energy resources. The proposed technology applies recent advances in photoelectrochemical cells and high-capacity photochromic materials to solar cells that could potentially enable all-day solar power.  The proposed customer-discovery efforts will lead to expanded technical capacity of the developed technology.  Commercializing this technology is expected to enable both overall energy load management and shorter term bridging power of solar cells, and address the growing need for daily renewable energy supply with the expanding penetration of solar energy into the U.S. If successful, this will also minimize the need to build and operate spinning-reserve power plants, a method employed today to close the gaps between power consumption and generation.

    This I-Corps project explores commercial application opportunities for next-generation solar cells with integrated storage capability. Currently, most solar batteries are simply a physical addition of a storage device such as a battery or supercapacitor to a solar cell. Such construction involves complicated cell architectures and control processes, and can be prohibitively expensive. To circumvent the problems with the current state-of-the-art in solar energy storage, this proposed technology centers on a dual-function electrode on a photoelectrochemical cell construction, which simultaneously generates and stores electricity during the day, and discharge at night. Differentiators include: simple construction resulting in lower fabrication and maintenance costs, easy scalability and market penetration since the modular panel design is compatible with the existing PV infrastructure; low maintenance because at night or under low-light conditions the discharge is automatically activated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the commercial potential of an educational innovation that can transform aspects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and arts education in both formal and informal settings through the construction, analysis, and performance upon a set of custom musical instruments.  By coupling rigorous STEM learning with musical concepts, the technology can engage a diverse group of students in STEM who may otherwise not express an interest.  The technology may be commercialized in a variety of ways, ranging from kits for the home market to complete curricula for school programs.  Commercialization of the technology has significant potential to improve educational outcomes in these important STEM areas.

    This I-Corps project builds upon a technology base of custom acoustical and electronic musical instruments that was initially developed for an educational program that has been attended by over 2,000 people in 10 states at schools, museums, and performing arts centers.  The intellectual merit of the work derives from the close coupling between musical content and state K-12 standards in mathematics, science, and engineering.  A pilot 6-week after school program for third grade students used the technology to draw connections between music and fractions, geometry, the physics of sound, engineering materials, and engineering design, which are all topics in the educational standards for that grade level.  Prototype instruments for higher grade levels illustrate concepts in algebra, pre-calculus, electronics, and computer programming.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to help bring safe self-driving vehicles to market more quickly. Self-driving vehicles could eliminate over 90% of the 35,000 annual traffic fatalities that occur in the United States alone, convert commuting time into increased productivity or leisure time, and completely overhaul society's relationship with transportation. Billions of dollars are actively being invested by established automotive manufacturers, technology companies, startups, and researchers. The self-driving vehicle market is projected to be $27 billion by 2025, and grow to $77 billion by 2035. Despite all of the activity, there is still a gap in the ability to test self-driving vehicles in between the two current methods of computer simulations and full sized vehicles. Scaled vehicle technology provides an intermediate method to enable faster prototyping and testing of new algorithms and electronics in the real world without the risks and costs associated with full sized vehicles. This would provide immense value to society both in terms of accelerating a large new industry and reducing human casualties and injuries of the transportation system.

    This I-Corps project will investigate the commercial potential of a self-driving vehicle industry testbed.  It involves a combination of new theory and algorithms with hardware systems that interact in the real world. The technology platform is a scaled vehicle testbed, 1/5 the size of a car and weighing 45 lbs.  It includes a sensor suite, onboard computer, and is ready for self-driving testing out of the box. Using these as autonomous vehicle testbeds, self-driving vehicle technologies can be tested in the real world without endangering people or expensive equipment. This technology is based on a fleet of prototype autonomous vehicle testbeds that have been used for controls, machine learning, and computer vision research successfully applied to the self-driving domain.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide automatic prosthetic tuning technology that will enable the optimization of metabolic energy expenditure in impaired gait of amputee users. This product will simplify the process of tuning and will increase the performance of powered prosthetic legs to better assist users and provide more balance while maintaining a lower energy expenditure on residual muscles. Due to the product's user-friendly structure, it could easily be used in less-equipped environments, which will make the technology more accessible and eliminate the discomfort of long commutes to the prosthetic laboratory or clinics. This is a cost-effective solution for not only broader use of powered prosthetic legs, but also better efficiency of prosthetic laboratory and clinics to serve more prosthetic users. This will reduce the cost of maintaining powered prosthetic legs and, broaden the facilities that would offer these types of services. Also, since the system is automated a clinician will replace some of the tasks typically done by prosthetic experts, which is expected to reduce overall costs.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the core technology. Lower limb amputees use prosthetics for daily walking; however, walking with prosthesis typically requires much more metabolic energy expenditure than people with normal gait. Current state-of-the-art technology provides powered prosthetic legs to better assist amputees. To have the best assistance and to increase balance, these legs require a meticulous tuning procedure. It is currently conducted using an observation-based approach by prosthetic experts; however, this approach is not accurate and lacks objectivity. The developed technology is able to wirelessly collect body area sensor signals and provide computational algorithms to automatically setup powered prosthetic legs, which provides a novel and efficient technique for optimizing the metabolic energy expenditure in impaired gait of amputees. This technology will enable an accurate and objective tuning for the users, which is cost effective because it may reduce the need for frequent prosthetic clinics for prosthesis adaptation. In addition, the objective and accurate tuning will maximize the use of powered prosthetic legs.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps project involves a novel probiotic, which potentially treats gut problems including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), weight gain, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).  Many key mechanisms of the human body are in part control by the microbes that live in our gut. The way that we currently view, diagnose, and treat many diseases is fundamentally changing with this knowledge. While dozens of diseases are now intrinsically tied with dysbiosis in the gut, of which 1000s of species of microbes reside, we currently have few probiotics as treatment despite the fact that the number of human clinical trials on probiotics in the past 10 years has increased 20-fold. When developed, this technology can potentially be applied to supplements and drugs to help counter noncompliance, and therefore have a significant commercial impact in other fields as well. This is, in addition, to the broad reaching impact on helping individuals with gut problems, which is estimated to be over 50 million. This product also provides an irritant free alternative for those desiring a regular probiotic.

    This I-Corps project surrounds the bacteria, Paenibacillus 79-R4 (Pb 79-R4), which has been isolated and characterized.  In vitro trials show very encouraging results that indicated that this strain drastically reduces enteric methane and hydrogen production, which could be transferred to a commercial product.  Pb 79-R4 eliminates the gases that are positively correlated with gut problems in humans- in animal models the supplemental-Pb strain decreased methane-producing activity by over 50%. This technology will also include a prebiotic and a novel beverage-based interactive mode of delivery, which will work in synergy with the bacteria and lets the user know it is working allowing the effects of the probiotic to work faster and decrease the abandonment period in first-time users. In addition, results from in vitro simulations have resulted in significant reductions in certain pathogens.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase the applications of wearable sensory modality (vision, vestibular, and/or proprioception) specific devices to encourage mobility and optimize movement for patients suffering from increased disequilibrium symptoms, such as vertigo or dizziness, and other fall risk comorbidity factors. This project will potentially enhance the delivery of rehabilitative care by clinical providers to their patients by simultaneously improving their patients' health outcomes and quantitatively demonstrating value in their treatment plans. Similarly, by serving as a channel to implement balance interventions to mitigate the high rates of falls among older adults, this project will support efforts by health care providers, senior advocacy groups, and hospital facility administrators to reduce the associated treatment costs.

    This I-Corps project enables the ameliorating effects of low random vestibular stimulation on balance coordination during stance and locomotion to be extended during an individual's daily routine in a non-research or clinical setting. The basis for the technique is a wearable device capable of delivering low electrical currents non-invasively to the individual's vestibular system through the mastoids. Sensory reweighting and integration are paramount to sustaining balance control in dynamic environments and deficits in those processes are frequently associated with balance impairments during gait and stance. Therefore, by leveraging the apparent postural responses induced in an individual, the technology has the potential to support a variety of motor adaption or retraining paradigms for balancing training and fall prevention.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is clinicians being able to evaluate therapy impact implemented on individual patients by quantifying real-time tissue kinematics response to a procedure. While tools that objectify therapeutic intervention outcomes are desirable, they are not often available, where the procedure's results are usually unknown until it is too late to redirect the outcomes. Such a delay could exacerbate a patient's symptoms, requiring additional interventions or diagnostic tests, increasing costs and professional liabilities. This innovation greatly improves the possibility of objectifying therapy outcomes or planned interventions to ensure success on performed treatments. As an example, this innovation can quantify uterine C-section scar tissue integrity, allowing Obstetricians and Gynecologists to reduce risk during births that involve women with previous C-section history. Additional promising applications include, more precise speech language pathology diagnosis and physical therapy treatment validation.

    This I-Corps project is based on an innovative method that measures displacement and strain in tissue and body fluid for determining the accuracy and objectivity of clinical tests and the effectiveness of treatment procedures. The novel method developed, processes an image time series obtained using typical diagnostic tools, such as ultrasound, MRI, or CT scan imaging, to quantify target tissue displacement and strain. Contemporary methods, such as Tissue Doppler Imaging, require cross-sectional plane imaging, restricting strain measurements to a single component. The method developed here identifies functions without the necessity for natural markers and yields all components of the strain tensor field at a much finer resolution. Further, repeatability of this novel method's function has been assessed by conducting multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments. The method's versatility has been demonstrated by quantifying kinematics for variety of biological tissues, such as median and sciatic nerves, surrounding muscle, and subcutaneous tissue.

    The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project is a miniaturized, on-demand pharmaceutical manufacturing platform that is scalable and efficient to deploy, highly automated, and fast on product release. The project's aim is to reduce manufacturing and inventory cost and in turn overcome drug shortages. Broadly speaking, the current global pharmaceutical industry is prone to supply chain disruptions, drug shortages, and drug price hikes. One major contributing factor are legacy factories and processes which are limited to intermittent and slow production. Moreover, the outdated infrastructure has weaknesses in terms of product yield and environmental impact. Given the pressure of meeting demand for clinical trial supplies, uncertainties over approvals, and other resource constraints, drug development activities have often only been a series of process scale-ups with less emphasis on innovating on the next-gen manufacturing processes, which can be fundamentally better in all aspects in the long term. Consequently, this project is a significant push towards a more flexible, economical, greener, and, ultimately, more sustainable drug manufacturing infrastructure.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of a microfluidic-based, continuous-flow pharmaceutical manufacturing device. It represents a paradigm shift from conventional, labor-intensive, batch drug manufacturing processes. Microfluidics (MFDs) are fabricated microchannels which are up to a thousand times smaller than a conventional batch reactor for the same throughput. In turn, MFDs offer up to a thousand times increase in the surface area to volume ratio, allowing for extremely rapid heat and mass transfer and a suite of other advantages; Since the process is continuous, the system can be spatially integrated with state-of-the-art analytical sensors and computer-based controllers, by which the product quality can be assured not only by process design, but also by advanced process control. From a synthesis and purification perspective, MFDs allow for precise handling of previously inaccessible, but highly efficient, pressurized, and often exothermic pathways. This results in greener and safer processes with higher throughput and less waste. On the formulation side, MFDs provide homogeneous crystallization environments, leading to monodisperse crystal size distributions, which leads to superior reproducibility in key product quality such as shape and size.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to enable cost-effective deployment of multiple small satellites, which can provide greater utility than a small number of large satellites. Lack of launch capacity has created a substantial and rapidly growing backlog of unlaunched small satellites. Providing low cost and increased capacity for launch of miniaturized satellites will enable important scientific and communication capabilities that larger satellites are unable to cost-effectively perform. These include low data rate communications, network constellations to gather data from multiple points, in-orbit inspection of larger satellites, and university related research. This will enable more university atmospheric-based research and, since low-orbit satellites pass over a specific geographic area more frequently than large satellites, they can be used for rapid response to disasters or to gather timely information relating to telemedicine, environmental management, and asset tracking. as well as enhanced communication capability in remote regions.

    This I-Corps project will contribute to addressing the technical and logistical challenges associated with the deployment and altitude control of balloons as platforms for launching small satellites. The architecture is broken into key subsystems. Initially, research and development was focused on the Launch Orientation and Control System (LOC). Subsequently, development focused on building and testing several subsystems that can execute suborbital launch. This includes the continued development of the LOC System, design and integration of a wireless communication system, and a robust flight system capable of testing at low altitudes under tethered control. Two successful tests were conducted, including a tethered flight integration test and third launch test. The team will continue address technical hurdles have yet to be resolved, including safe tethering connection and handling of the rocket, a semi-controllable buoyancy system, quick deflation method, central skeletal structure integration, and remote communication.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in the development a novel system that would allow people with transradial and partial hand amputations to gain unparalleled precise individuation of prosthetic digit motion including continuous and simultaneous movement for individual digits without requiring long and complicated training process. To allow for such functionality a novel set of deep learning algorithms are designed to model muscle movement patterns from ultrasound images. The network is pre-trained with a large amount of data in an effort to minimize later individual training. In addition to power prosthetics, the proposed technology can provide broad impacts in other markets where easy-to-use and accurate gestural control of robotics and/or digital environment are required. These include tele-robotics, exoskeleton operation, virtual reality, gaming, glove boxes as well as work related Personal Protective Equipment, and Performance Augmentation and Amplification Devices.

    This I-Corps project will develop and utilize a novel ultrasound sensor and novel deep learning algorithms to recognize continuous muscle activity patterns that can predict accurate and dexterous finger motion. Current myoelectric powered prostheses use discrete classifiers that can only predict a limited number of discrete gestures from noisy electromyography (EMG) signal. Feeding deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, with rich and detailed ultrasound signal promises to allow for the modeling and prediction of detailed continuous and simultaneous muscle movements patterns, which can be mapped to control continuous and simultaneous movements of individual prosthetic fingers. An additional intellectual of this project merit is the pre-training of these deep neural network with a large amount of data, which would allow for short fine tuning training for individual users, allowing for wide and easy adoption of the technology. The proposed project could therefore allow amputees and people with upper body disabilities to perform finger-by-finger movement activities such as fine object manipulation, typing or playing a musical instrument.

Modularity offers a unique opportunity to address needs in multiple markets with a single solution when coupled with a suite of specific attachment modules.  It is envisioned that the platform will first be adopted by law enforcement.  Other market that will be explored include defense applications, where there seems to be interest in throwable robots.  Robotic assistance for environmental management is another potential market area.

    This I-Corps project is based on developments in small mobile robots for applications in search, rescue and reconnaissance.  This modular platform is designed to support efforts in the context of "robotics science of safety."  Novel aspects in design provide more advanced mobility characteristics than currently available platforms. The locomotion designs spawns new questions and opportunities for basic research in legged locomotion.  A modular form-factor makes this robot accessible to a larger audience, with an inexpensive baseline model that can be upgraded with sensor and hardware packages as needed by the customers.  Throwable, and miniature sized robots are currently an asset to operations involving reconnaissance, inspection and characterization in dangerous environments.  Driven by customer feedback, the features of this robot can carefully evolve to meet the needs of each customer segment.

    The commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a computational platform that facilitates multiple entities to transact where data owned by different stakeholders is used but not disclosed to anyone, including the platform. The resulting transaction would allow entities to make informed decisions about not only choosing from a pool of potential partners but also explore avenues to generate value from their potential partnership(s). This platform eliminates any possibility of losing ownership of data as well as any misuse/abuse of data in transactions. Consequently, it would motivate partnerships among disparate entities, leading to value enhancements and new products. It can be a game changer in allowing a range of businesses to create new products/services, especially when such businesses are complimentary to each other.  Moreover, this platform would allow personalized service deliveries to end customers, involving different entities, who can collaborate without exchanging data.

    This I-Corps project uses a suite of building blocks within its computational platform to perform mutually-agreed computations. Each building block is designed to perform a specific arithmetic or a logical operation using a single external server (SES), wherein the server learns nothing about the inputs. The entities using these building blocks learn only the outputs of the computation but not their collaborators' inputs. Thus, computations executed using these building blocks preserve input confidentiality and data ownership for every involved entity. There are existing technologies that achieve some of the stated functionalities but they either use multiple external servers or computationally intensive cryptographic techniques. These requirements substantially affect the performance overhead and scalability, which make it difficult to deploy them in real-world applications. In contrast, this SES-based building blocks lead to substantial reductions in performance overhead as compared to the existing technologies and are easily scalable.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to act as a catalyst in the growth of distributed generation and microgrid industries. This artificial intelligence based control system will potentially provide an electrical network that is reliable by reducing outages and restoration costs with incredibly fast bidirectional power flow, secured with real time diagnostics, self-healing and adaptive capabilities, and more economical by reducing equipment failures and minimizing power losses. The product potentially three broad markets, including utilities, distributed generation and consumer. The solution will enhance energy generation from renewables, improve microgrid efficiency, reliability, stability and power quality, and add intelligent control to conventional power systems. Inverter capabilities are presently a significant challenge for integrating distributed generation sources. The proposed innovation would potentially provide an appropriate solution to address this challenge.

    This I-Corps project develops a neural network control technology for microgrid control and management. Microgrids are one path for integrating renewable and distributed generation sources into the grid and can generally support a future smart electricity grid.  A key challenge in microgrid adoption is adequate control of power inverters. Problems include high oscillations when connecting or disconnecting an energy source, fluctuating voltage and frequency, malfunctions and reliability, competing control between inverters, and high harmonic distortions. The proposed innovation uses adaptive dynamic programming and artificial neural networks to implement microgrid control. It integrates into one controller the advantages of conventional control methods, including optimal control, proportional integral control, predictive control, and sliding mode control. The proposed innovation has the potential to overcome the limitations of the conventional control technologies and better meet customer demands and requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes providing weather-related risk information to construction contracting companies, private farmers, insurance and re-insurance companies, risk management companies, local, federal agencies, state agencies, and any other company that may be impacted by adverse weather. This product provides insight into the impacts of adverse weather conditions, allowing its constituents to plan and prepare. Construction companies need to stay on schedule to avoid liquidated damages, so it is important to determine the impacts of weather on work stoppage, as well as decreased labor productivity.  Insurance and risk management companies need information on the impacts of weather events on their constituents, to be able to competitively price their insurance policies. Furthermore, government agencies, such as the Departments of Transportation and Public Works need information on the impacts of weather on duration of their projects, to determine the best starting date for construction, considering impacts of weather on delays.

    This I-Corps project provides a software tool (Weather Augmented Risk Determination System, WARDS) for estimating probabilities of work stoppage and labor productivity for each hour using long-term observations. WARDS provides both the likeliest delay (e.g., in days or months) and the likelihood that a user-defined addition of time for weather delay will actually occur.  The research potential for this product include analyzing the differences in labor productivity and work stoppage across multiple locations. Furthermore, the technology platform can determine the historical observed changes in labor productivity and work stoppage. The product can determine the monetary impacts of changing labor productivity and work stoppage due to weather.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce or eliminate damage/loss of property and protect public health and safety by introducing infrared and eye-safe laser radar (lidar) technology for high sensitivity remote plume characterization.  The technology has the potential to meet a diverse range of customer sectors for such applications including: early detection of wildfires; tracking pesticides drift in agricultural settings; tracking dispersion and transport of air toxins and pollutants in civilian and military settings; and detecting emissions and leaks in industrial settings. Lidar has already successfully penetrated a range of markets including range finders, speed monitors, 3D imaging and surveying systems, cloud ceiling height measurement at airports and weather centers, and most recently for remote wind measurements in wind energy applications. Successful introduction of laser radar systems to new markets can have significant economic, safety and health impacts.

    This I-Corps project capitalizes on compact eye-safe infrared lidar technology developed for remote characterization of atmospheric aerosols or target trace gases with high sensitivity.  The systems utilize robust infrared laser transmitters such as semiconductor lasers, fiber lasers, or quantum cascade lasers, operating at eye-safe levels, and yet achieving high detection sensitivities.  Because these sources are invisible to the human eye, they do not interfere with operators of machinery or aircraft and can be broadly deployed.  The systems are built on a rigid carbon fiber platform to add to their robustness in a broad range of ambient temperatures.  The lasers operate in the pulsed mode with pulse duration in the nanosecond range and at high pulse repetition rates to tens of kilohertz.  The lidar receiver section employs state-of-the-art infrared detectors together with hardware and software signal processing to achieve required performance levels.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes smart algorithm-driven superior stents for use in Urology, Gastrointestinal surgery, ENT surgery and Neurosurgery.  Patients suffering from malignant obstruction, benign biliary strictures, biliary leaks, bile duct stones, transplants, pancreatic strictures due to malignancy, pancreatic fistulae, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreas divisum would potentially benefit from this technology. Almost 112,000 people are treated for these conditions every year in the U.S. The invention is expected to significantly improve performance over currently used plastic/teflon based stents and also augment functionality on many fronts.

    This I-Corps project will focus on assessing the market requirements to refine the design of a novel  Multi-Axis Deformable Sensor/Actuator that is based on the principle of tensegrity. It offers a lightweight actuator system with 6 degrees of freedom of manipulation. This provides the opportunity to create 3-dimensional structures that can be delivered to a desired anatomical/surgical site in the human body for the purpose of repairing strictures, in a low profile and can be expanded to the desired shape.  This system offers a new generation of intra-body luminal space maintainers, stents, and expanders. The main value proposition is guaranteed stent retention. The device involves smart algorithms that sense the states (angles, loads) of the system and locally activates them to achieve a desired spatio-temporal support. These algorithms are run in real-time, in embedded processor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is an efficacious alternative for antibiotics and in treating antibiotic resistant bacteria in a number of fields, including, healthcare, self-care, agriculture, sanitation, animal health, and research. The CDC estimates that in 2013 more than 2 million people had an antibiotic resistant infection, and 23,000 people died due to antibiotic resistance. The costs to society of antibiotic resistance are $20 billion in direct medical costs, and as much as $35 billion in lost productivity-these are the savings in healthcare alone. The potential impact on self-care is a competitive and safe alternative to OTC treatments for bacterial related issues, such as acne, which affects more than 80% of the population at some point in their lives, and has a market size of $644 million. The potential impact on the animal health industry would be a replacement for growth-promoting antibiotics.

    This I-Corps project core technology is a software and hardware platform that combines a method for creating precision disease models with a novel solution for the discovery of a narrow band lytic bacteriophage. This discovery platform enables the elimination of many of the bottlenecks and short falls of traditional phage and antibiotic product discovery to improve isolation rates of unique, diverse anti-infective candidates. When used in conjunction with regular metagenomic monitoring of a target environment, the technology is able to model a custom phage cocktail to ensure a specific functional profile using combinatorics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project it to reduce the impact of future earthquakes.  This smartphone-based crowdsource sensing application provides earthquake alerts and shaking hazard data. The vision is to provide earthquake early warning around the globe, and collect data on building performance.  Warnings can be used to slow and stop trains reducing the likelihood of derailment, to isolate hazardous chemicals and machinery to reduce damage, to move data to safe storage, and to signal individuals to move to a safe place.  Shaking data recoded in buildings can also be used to assess the performance of a building during an earthquake.  Recorded shaking in smaller non-damaging quakes can be used to predict building performance in larger events.  The data recorded by application enabled phones can potentially be used by structural engineers to assess buildings, and can be used by the insurance industry to set premiums.

    This I-Corps project develops a global smartphone-based seismic network.  The technology uses machine learning techniques to distinguish between earthquakes and other sources of shaking as recorded on personal/private smartphones, and is embedded in the application that has been downloaded by over 250,000 users around the world.  When a phone detects an earthquake, it notifies a central server.  The server confirms the earthquake based on multiple phone detection, and estimates the size and location.  An alert could then be issued to users.  At the same time, the phone records the ground shaking during the earthquake.  This timeseries data can be used for a range of purposes including fundamental research on earthquake processes, and characterization of buildings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to generate technology that improves the accuracy of medical diagnostic tests and eases restrictions on the collection of tissue from patients. If it can be widely disseminated through commercialization, this technology will allow patients to receive a more accurate diagnosis of diseases like cancer, with a more rapid turnaround time and lower cost to the healthcare system. Moreover, secondary biopsies or blood draws that are painful and expensive can be avoided. The project has exceptional potential for commercialization due to the multi-billion dollar market for diagnostic tests at present and due to clear pressing clinical needs to fill in technological gaps that limit the accuracy of diagnostic tests for cancer.

    The I-Corps project is focused on a new generation of light-emitting nanoparticles that function as the critical means to perform measurements in medical diagnostic tests. These new nanoparticles, called quantum dots, provide the new ability to count individual molecules in diseased tissue and in blood, which is a major leap forward in diagnostic testing compared with standard tests that simply provide a qualitative outcome of "high" or "low." Moreover, quantum dots allow the simultaneous interrogation of numerous classes of molecules related to diseases, instead of having to perform repeated tests. Importantly, this technology can be implemented on low-cost instruments that are already widely available in medical diagnostics labs, so there are few barriers preventing entry into the market.  Outcomes have been validated in a research laboratory setting, however they must be scaled for commercialization and finely tuned to meet specific needs in medical diagnostics settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project addresses the treatment of musculoskeletal disease and injury, which are among the most common reasons patients seek medical treatment. These procedures arise from treatment of traumatic injury, congenital defects, tumor resection, and joint replacements. Bone fractures comprise a majority of these disorders with 6.2 million fractures. However, it is estimated that up to 10 percent of these bone defects are associated with improper healing. Without the aid of a bone graft material, these defects result in low structural integrity and potentially result in amputation. The gold standard of treatment relies on using bone from the patient as a graft. The technology under developed by this project, extracellular matrix derived from osteogenic stem cells, offers a bone graft material with equivalent healing properties to a patient's bone graft without the potential chronic pain and risk of infection associated with the harvesting a bone graft. From a scientific perspective, this project represents a disruptive change to all cell-derived matrix technologies, and as a result has the potential to drive innovative tissue engineering-based solutions to regenerate other tissues.

    This I-Corps project aims to generate an osteogenic bone graft material derived from cultured mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The technology coaxes hMSCs to differentiate into an intermediate osteogenic phenotype that can be used generate extracellular matrix that mimics the primitive stroma deposited during embryological bone development and during bone repair in adults. When purified from the cells, this material exhibits remarkable biocompatibility and significantly increases retention of engrafted hMSCs, with far greater binding capacity than commonly employed bone substitutes. Importantly, these properties accelerate bone repair and spinal fusion in animal models. Methods have been developed to produce and harvest this matrix from hMSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that can be theoretically expanded indefinitely, hence it is possible to now produce large amounts of osteogenic matrix with reliable properties. Further, these cells are actually able to produce matrix in much higher quantities than that produced by bone marrow-derived hMSCs. This is a platform technology to harvest and combine this matrix with surgical collagen sponge or other suitable scaffolds as a replacement for currently used allogenic scaffolds.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is providing an affordable and effective means to produce freshwater supplies from brackish water sources. Freshwater shortages have pushed many communities to increasingly rely on groundwater supplies. Several hundred million people worldwide already experience serious water-stress, and their numbers are expected to increase as freshwater availability declines owing to increasing demand.  While available fresh groundwater aquifers are limited, there exist considerable amounts of low-to-intermediate salinity brackish groundwater sources that remain unused. Unfortunately, existing desalination technologies are either too energy intensive, have low water recovery rates, or are prohibitively expensive. There is a significant need and commercial opportunity for new technologies that can efficiently convert brackish aquifers into viable freshwater supplies. This project allows for the development of a robust, low cost, energy efficient brackish water desalination technology with potential use beyond drinking water treatment, including food processing, agriculture, and other industrial applications.

    This I-Corps project will evaluate the commercialization potential of a new technology that will potentially lower the cost of brackish water treatment by reducing the capital, operation and maintenance, and waste management costs compared to existing alternatives. The lower capital cost is achieved by using novel composite electrode materials developed using inexpensive and industrially-scaled precursors. The reduction in operation and maintenance costs are benefits from realizing unique operating modes made possible by the novel electrodes. The new operating modes also eliminate need for harsh chemicals, and instead use low-voltage electricity to regenerate the electrodes after they have captured the dissolved salts from the water being treated.  The regeneration leads to a reject stream of concentrated brine, while the adsorption leads to a stream of treated water that is fresh (less saline than the inlet water). The higher water recovery rates in this system minimize the amount of waste generated, subsequently allowing for cost savings in waste management.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project can transform the waste vegetable oil industry and influence the markets of other biofuels.  The innovative method comes from using a modular design with novel supercritical processing technology that utilizes value added by-product recycle.  This technology improves profitability by bringing processing facilities closer to the consumer and creating local jobs in rural communities, thus improving rural economic activity.   The commercial potential of this technology can transform how waste vegetable oil is used, rendered, and processed in the United States and around the world.  These marketplaces are of significant interest to the federal and state governments because of energy security, rural economic growth and sustainable energy production.  Commercial impacts of this technology influence other biofuels markets.

    This I-Corps project will explore the market potential  of a Transportable Micro Bio Refinery (TmBR) that converts waste vegetable oil (WVO) into biodiesel to using a novel 2-stage Separative-reactor.  Generating biodiesel from WVO is commonly done using a Base-Catalyzed Low-Pressure process referred to as the Fatty-Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) process.  Bio-diesel produced in centralized bio-refineries are not competitive with petro-diesel with low priced crude.  Capital costs, feedstock supply costs, and environmental costs to dispose of process waste make centralized refineries uneconomically.  By comparison, the TmBR process uses an advanced super-critical separative reactor without a catalyst to reduce process waste and operating costs.  In addition, the TmBR process includes a bio-digestor to convert waste glycerol to methanol which is recycled to reduce the need to purify and dispose of waste glycerol.  The TmBR process requires a smaller operating footprint, involves lower capital costs and reduced operating costs and has less environmental impact that makes this technology more economically competitive compared to standard FAME based biodiesel plants.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop an understanding of the market needs for a novel biodegradable tether and inserter technology. Researchers have developed an inserter device which delivers a temporary tether into living tissue that can constrain medical devices within the body, while also permitting those devices to be easily removed if desired. Numerous surgical and implant applications might benefit from commercialization of this technology, and the market needs for these applications will be explored in this project.  A potential application of the technology is with postpartum intrauterine devices (IUD) where this will mitigate medical complications caused by IUD expulsion events.

    This I-Corps project focuses on a novel technology for inserting a biodegradable tether into living tissue and interfacing with existing medical devices.  This technology must permit the medical devices to be held in place during normal operation, but allow easy removal when desired.  Researchers have fabricated alpha and beta prototypes that demonstrate reliable insertion of a biodegradable tether into explanted muscle tissue and shown sufficient anchoring force to constrain a medical device.  Using the same tether, researchers have demonstrated easy removal of a medical device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in allowing property owners to fully develop their land for economic benefit, while satisfying regulatory requirements and, at the same time, protecting the water resources that we rely on for water supply, environmental benefits and recreation. Currently, land owners use developable land to manage storm water. This project will consider how to best use the soil throughout the site to manage the storm water and free up more of the site for development. By spreading out runoff that naturally concentrates when we construct buildings, roads and parking lots more water can soak into the ground. With this infiltration, pollutants picked up on the land surface can be removed by the soil rather than flowing directly to a stream. Infiltrated water moves underground to streams and provides the continuous stream flow needed by wildlife. Distributing runoff to the soil surrounding our buildings and pavement can also help keep runoff out of the combined storm and sanitary sewers found in many older communities, allowing the aging infrastructure to continue to function and reducing the combined sewer overflows.

    This I-Corps project will result in a new solution, transforming the way storm water runoff is managed; improving water quality and maintaining stream baseflow required by wildlife, while decreasing costs and requiring less space to meet permitting requirements. The solution consists of devices that are specially constructed to slow down the flow of water and redirect it in a way that allows it to seep into the surrounding soil. The core technology is based upon the well-established principle that the size, mix and way materials are arranged determines the way liquids flow. A patent for the solution has been issued because of the new, innovative way of constructing and deploying these simple materials (i.e., sand and gravel placed in tubes of the geotextile fabric often used in landscaping), allowing water to be directed in three dimensions. Concentrated runoff, for example the accelerated flow of water off a parking lot, that is intercepted by the device, is first slowed and then directed down into the soil or is moved left or right to the next device segment.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps Team project is a new collagen-mimetic material that will lead to the development of safer, cheaper, and customizable products for medical applications. Collagen has applications in medicine, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, food industry, and leather industry.  The incidences of transmission of pathogens from animal products have added to the market pressure for safer, non-mammalian sources of collagens. The novel, collagen-mimetic fibrils are expected to be a safe collagen-alternative for many collagen-related applications.  These new materials can be designed to cater the needs of specific applications and is potentially more versatile and effective than the traditional collagen products. The potential commercial impact is a new generation of collagen-related biomaterials for skin care, bone and joint health, controlled drug release devices, and wound healing.

    This I-Corps Team project will identify and establish relationships with potential partners across the medical field and the personal care industry. Collagen has long been sought after for its combination of tensile strength and biocompatibility. The emerging peptide biotechnology raised hope of producing collagen-mimetic peptides that can be a safe, economically viable alternative to collagens extracted from animals. Until recently, however, protein design could not produce peptide materials that adapt to the fibril conformation of natural collagens. This project builds upon the development of the first of such fibril-forming triple helical peptide. The self-assembled collagen-mimetic fibrils have the characteristic axial repeating structure reminiscent of that of the D-period of fibrillar collagens in tissues. The collagen-mimetic fibrils can be used as molecular scaffold to create biomaterials that have the supramolecular structure and the tensile strength comparable to that of natural collagen fibrils. The bottom-up approach makes it possible to customize the materials for specific applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to introduce a fully integrated current sensor with an order of magnitude performance improvement over the state-of-art technologies. The developed technology will enable more reliable, efficient and compact power electronics systems. Power electronics is an integral part of today's power delivery systems such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, data centers and most consumer electronics. In these applications, electric current information is often an essential parameter that needs to be known and measured for control, diagnostic and prognostic purposes. With advances in power electronic circuits with specific attention to high frequency power converters, there is a need to investigate alternative approaches and techniques to measure the current. These approaches should result in availability of current sensors that have fast-response, are accurate, loss-less, and preferably non-intrusive. The impact of such a sensor is to enable systems and circuits that will be miniaturized and more efficient through the use of wide band-gap semiconductors and high switching frequencies. Additionally, the availability of current measurement information will lead to greater reliability and prognostic capability. Applications include power converters in electric vehicles and data centers.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the current sensor technology in different industry sectors such as automotive, telecommunications, and data centers. Today, there is no current sensor that can be used in many power electronics systems or integrated into semiconductor modules optimized to operate with switching frequencies beyond 1MHz. This project will address the need and requirements for such sensors by moving away from commonly-used Hall-Effect sensors and utilizing magneto-resistors. With proprietary IC circuitry and packaging, the project team is developing contactless, lossless sensors with bandwidths up to 10 MHz, while overcoming the measurement challenges due to EMI, asymmetrical current distributions and non-uniform magnetic field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is revolutionizing how farmers grow their crops and significantly reduced the dependence on fertilizers or pesticides to maximize yields. Understanding how to manipulate natural components of the plant stress response to provide desirable beneficial traits will potentially lead to reductions in chemical use in agriculture.  This technology provides a novel mechanism to express broad spectrum immune response that would normally stunt plant growth. This novel mechanism has large potential societal and commercial impacts. Currently, agricultural companies express resistance genes using promoter systems that are specific for one strain of pathogen. Each resistance gene included in the plant seed results in a negative fitness cost. The technology developed here can potentially eliminate the need to express multiple resistance genes by replacing them with one broad spectrum resistance gene.

    This I-Corps project further develops a TBF1-Control Cassette technology (TCC) to regulate translation that is both inducible and specific. Current gene expression methods are primarily based on transcriptional regulation utilizing synthetic or native promoters, which were shown to be insufficient in overcoming negative fitness costs associated with expression of stress response genes. The TCC technology remediates these negative fitness cost by "stalling" the translation of the gene of interest until a trigger is present. This mechanism allows for the accumulation of transcripts without the subsequent translation, and hence no negative fitness costs until the protein is translated. The technology was proven to work in rice and can be applied to other economically important crops, such as wheat or corn.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of simple and low-cost point-of-care microfluidic molecular (DNA/RNA) tests that are designed to be used in decentralized or low-resource settings. Currently, point-of-care tests for infectious diseases are predominately done in a paper dipstick format. Although these dipstick tests are inexpensive, they have limited sensitivity. As an alternative, the most sensitive detection method entails DNA/RNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), however PCR testing often requires time-consuming manual steps and costly equipment. Because of its cost, PCR is generally confined to centralized laboratories, so front-line decentralized clinics can suffer days to weeks of delay in testing results because samples need to be sent out for testing. Low-cost nucleic acid detection is desirable for point-of-care diagnostics; The availability of an on-site molecular tests will give doctors a powerful tool to confirm diagnosis of infectious diseases and allow faster treatment with higher sensitivity. This project will help confirm the best product-market strategy to deploy the technology, and guide the development of devices that makes positive impact for better patient management, increased accessibility to molecular testing, and a faster response to epidemics.

    This I-Corps project is based on several patented microfluidic technologies developed for on-site nucleic acid detection. The microfluidic chip is designed to reduce molecular testing setup costs by 100X. The key technologies include vacuum based self-powered microfluidic chips that do not require any costly equipment often necessary seen in conventional microfluidic setups (such as external pumps, controllers, valves, or power sources). This allows the microfluidic test to be a fraction of the cost compared to conventional microfluidics. The vacuum technology also makes the microfluidic chips fully portable and easily transportable, which is ideal for decentralized point-of-care use. It was also possible to perform sample preparation with the vacuum based microfluidic technology.  Using this vacuum based microfluidic platform, it is possible for rapid quantitative digital nucleic acid detection of drug resistant bacteria DNA directly from human blood samples within 30 minutes. These technical features are important building blocks for building autonomous, portable, lab-on-chip technologies for a future generation of low-cost molecular diagnostic assays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the commercialization of high value bio-oil from low value feedstocks, especially dairy process and other agricultural waste streams. The enabling fermentation bioprocess, called the carboxylate platform, produces a bio-oil consisting primarily of caproate (C6) and caprylate (C8), which are medium chain carboxylates (MCCs). Using ethanol containing feedstocks, the carboxylate platform delivers a sustainable MCC product with five times the market value of the feedstock. Use of a dairy process waste stream holds the promise of converting a feedstock acquisition cost to a substantial revenue through waste remediation. In addition, MCCs are currently extracted from palm oil, an industry which is raising significant ecological concerns due to large scale deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. In their raw form, MCCs currently have direct use as an animal feed supplement, but once refined, can also be used in the manufacture of detergents, care products, plastics, coatings, and pharmaceuticals, among many other applications.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization of a fermentation bioprocess which produces a bio-oil consisting primarily of caproate (C6) and caprylate (C8). This bioprocess, called the carboxylate platform, has demonstrated long-term stable production of bio-oil, has proven resistant to system disturbances, and is compatible with a variety of feedstocks. Using an ethanol-containing feedstock obtained from the bio-ethanol industry, rates has been achieved that are competitive with those of methane production from anaerobic digestion. The carboxylate platform adapts knowledge from anaerobic digestion, a widely used and scalable bioprocess using an open culture to generate methane gas from organic waste. The bio-oil produced by the carboxylate platform has a 30 times higher value per carbon than methane, making this platform an attractive alternative to anaerobic digestion for organic waste remediation. Especially promising is the possibility of converting dairy process waste to this valuable bio-oil. A key goal of this project is to identify manufacturing partners to optimize the extraction system to concentrate the bio-oil. Currently, this portion of the process is a critical driver of the capital cost. While the current platform is economically competitive, a less capital-intensive extraction system will lead to far greater profitability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will increase American manufacturing competitiveness and open new product opportunities.  The technology has the potential to expand the application space for 3D printing by removing current limitations on materials, achievable properties, and processing speed.  This will allow users to customize parts to user needs and reduce lead times for industries from medical devices to aerospace, to consumer products.  There are many opportunities in the 3D printing industry because it is rapidly growing (>15-20% per year).  The new approaches to manufacturing are transforming a wide variety of industries despite many pressing technical issues that remain.  The technology behind this project can open new markets/industries for these technologies by addressing some of the critical limitations.

    This I-Corps project will evaluate a modified process for additive manufacturing (3D Printing) with polymers from a powder feedstock. This is typically done by scanning the powder bed with a laser to locally fuse the powder particles together.  An alternative method is developed here that allows for economical fusing of the powder over longer time periods.  Current laser-based methods are constrained to utilizing a few specialized material types due to the process constraints.  While these work for many applications, there are many applications that require specialized materials that cannot be used in the current additive manufacturing methods.  This technology has the potential to expand the range of materials that can be successfully processed.  Additionally, the material properties produced by current methods are reduced relative to those obtained using traditional approaches such as injection molding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project would be in the development of a new approach to anti-fouling that can be used synergistically with other existing approaches. Surface fouling is encountered in a vast range of situations: biofouling of ships, biofouling of medical implant devices, thrombus formation on blood-contacting surfaces, mineral scale formation, and a variety of foulants in the food and chemicals industries. Surface fouling has high costs ranging from increased fuel cost in ships, poorer heat exchange in the chemical industry, infection or repeated surgery in the medical contexts, and increased equipment costs in water treatment. The technology offers wide-ranging benefits to society ranging from reduced infection of implanted medical devices, reduced operating costs in membrane filtration, and longer equipment life in the chemical industry.

    This I-Corps project seeks to evaluate the commercial potential of a new approach to anti-fouling surfaces. The fundamental principle underlying the strategy is to focus mechanical stress to the interface between the foulant and the surface, and thereby force deadhesion of the foulant. Successful in vitro experiments have been conducted showing that this principle can greatly reduce the fouling of surfaces placed in contact with blood or with platelet-enriched plasma. These results suggest that the principle can be applied regardless of the chemical nature of the surface.  The anti-fouling principle is purely mechanical and therefore may be used in conjunction with chemical modification approaches, such as fluorination. The technology is presently being evaluated with other foulants in a non-medical context, for instance in algal growth or mineral scale formation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to lower costs and increase the diversity of biofuels, chemicals, and therapeutics that can be produced by engineered cells that are used as 'living factories' in the biomanufacturing industry. Because cells are alive, they accumulate mutations as they grow. These mutations often reduce or even eliminate a cell's ability to make the product it was designed to manufacture. This project aims to commercialize technology for diagnosing what 'failure' mutations accumulate in these cells during production in large bioreactors. This capability will provide biotech companies with valuable information that they can use to re-engineer cells to prevent mutations from leading to losses of product yield. Thus, it has the potential to speed the progress of many new, renewable biomanufacturing processes from early R&D test stages to economically viable commercial production at scale.

    This I-Corps project centers on technology that provides diagnostic reports on the genetic stability of cells used in biomanufacturing through a combination of advanced next-generation sequencing and software workflows. This process can identify mutations that lead to a loss of production in a cell population while they are thousands of times rarer than can be detected by standard methods. Mutations that are rare when cells are grown at small scale will become dominant when cells are grown at larger production scales. Many such potential future failure mutations can be profiled in one small bioreactor using this technology. Comprehensively identifying failure mutations earlier in a R&D pipeline in this way such that they can re-engineer cells to prevent these problems before scale-up will save companies developing these processes time and money. This project explores the commercial viability of a service that provides these 'stability reports' to biomanufacturing companies in order to allow them to more rapidly overcome research and development obstacles related to mutations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps proposal lies in its potential to enable a new degree of precise control over medicines that could substantially increase the efficacy of many current therapeutics as well as re-invigorate the potential of drugs that previously failed clinical trials owing to unfavorable toxicity profiles. By enabling clinician-defined control over when and where a drug is active in the body, this technology has the potential to improve the efficacy of on-target effects while mitigating toxic side-effects that decrease patients' quality of life. Not only do pharmaceutical companies invest significant time and money honing the pharmacokinetics of each drug they bring to market, once a drug is in the clinic, companies have no means of altering the final product to adapt to the individual needs of patients. This project could streamline the costly process of tuning drugs' pharmacokinetics, while also improving their efficacy for a broader patient population.

    This I-Corps project is based on the combination of two enabling technologies. It combines advances in molecular engineering to create molecules whose activity can be controlled using different wavelengths of light, with a process for identifying light-responsive molecules that possess specific therapeutic properties of interest. Suites of light-switchable molecules have been designed in non-therapeutic contexts as a proof-of-concept, though these technologies have not yet been applied to therapeutics. A research pipeline for applying this technology to medically important molecules is being developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a closed loop synthetic carbon cycle that addresses both carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation as well as generating high value hydrocarbons from waste CO2 feedstock. Currently, fossil-fuel-fired power plants typically exhibit significant emissions of CO2.  The process developed here has the potential to capture this waste CO2 and repurpose it towards generation of hydrocarbon fuels and other high value hydrocarbons. It presents an opportunity for these electricity generation units to add profit margin in their business model based on these hydrocarbon chemicals. Similar opportunities are available to positively impact many other industries, as well.

    This I-Corps project develops a sustainable repurposing of CO2. The process, reverse water gas shift chemical looping (RWGS-CL) has demonstrated capability of converting CO2 to CO at high rates and at low temperatures, paving the way for implementation at large scale. The temperatures of operation of RWGS-CL allows for thermal integration with Fischer Tropsch process (FTS). With FTS reactors already being used in industrial scale, the reactor module developed here can potentially find an appropriate use in those industries. This process involves the use of stable catalysts that can be used for several cycles without loss of activity. The process is designed such that there is no intermixing of CO and H2O or H2, thereby restricting any methane formation or any backward reaction.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be significant because of the anticipated effect on improving product quality and safety for a large number of industry sectors. The project will lead to more reliance on virtual prototyping and less reliance on the costly and time consuming actual prototyping and experimental testing. Advanced virtual prototyping will result in more credible accident investigation reports and safety and operation guidelines, and will allow experimenting easily with innovative design configurations and for significant reduction in maintenance cost in many engineering areas, including transportation. Reliance on a single-software technology will eliminate the incompatibilities of existing computer-aided engineering (CAE) systems, improve communications, and produce a healthier work environment.

    This I-Corps project aims at addressing serious incompatibility issues attributed to the use of multiple computer-aided engineering (CAE) software systems developed using fundamentally different approaches. It is the main goal of this project to address this problem by using a new mechanics-based CAE framework in order to eliminate the incompatibilities and allow for developing models with unprecedented levels of accuracy and details. To this end, the finite element (FE) absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) will be used to seamlessly integrate the computer-aided design (CAD) and analysis processes by using one approach to create a unified geometry/FE analysis mesh and perform the multibody system (MBS) dynamic simulations. ANCF finite elements can be used to define a geometry that is invariant under an orthogonal coordinate transformation. In addition to describing the geometry accurately and performing the analysis efficiently, ANCF elements lead to an optimum sparse matrix structure for the dynamic equations of motion, leading to the development of new computational procedures that will drastically change the design process and eliminate the need for using multiple-software system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to apply innovative statistical methods of trait prediction to improve flavor in the agricultural, beverage and food industries. In conjunction with a growing societal concern about food safety and quality, there has been an increasing interest in developing food products that have enhanced flavor. Because many of the compounds that determine flavor are also associated with health benefits, increasing their content can also have other positive consequences. The development and commercial application of methods that predict and improve the flavor properties of food products will have a significant impact in an industry that is constantly seeking to increase consumer appeal of their products. In addition, the generation of large databases that relate flavor with the presence of specific compounds will be used to identify new additives for the food industry.  These favorable compounds can be potentially commercialized as a flavor enhancing additives.

    This I-Corps project aims at determining the commercial potential of new approaches developed to predict flavor and consumer appeal of food products using statistical methods, and identify those flavor-related compounds that are most valuable to the food industry. Food texture, flavor and odor are determined by chemical (e.g. volatiles) and physical properties, of which many can be quantified by mass spectrometry. By characterizing these compounds, innovative statistical Bayesian methods can be used to account for their combined effects in consumer appeal. As a consequence, it is possible to predict in advance how new products will perform in the market based on their individual profile. Despite the clear relevance of flavor to consumer preference and many of their well-described health benefits, many industries have been largely unable to incorporate these traits into their products. The approaches developed here will fill that gap. This innovation permits rapid, low-cost and high-throughput identification of cultivars that are most probable to be favored by consumers, without the need to establish costly, low-throughput consumer or expert flavor panels.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to improve the efficiency with which cellulosic ethanol can be produced. Cellulosic ethanol is produced from agricultural waste products, like corn stalks, switchgrass, and wheat straw, rather than from corn like traditional ethanol. It is then used largely as a fuel additive, though other industries use ethanol on smaller scales. Improving cellulosic ethanol production is part of the United States' Renewable Fuel Standards Goals set in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. These improvements are vital since the increased demand for ethanol from corn has contributed to rises in food prices.  In addition, cellulosic ethanol produces fewer greenhouse gases than corn ethanol production, and reduces pressure for water use and land change erosion. However, despite these advantages, the vast majority of ethanol produced in the US is from corn, simply because cellulosic ethanol is considerably more expensive to produce. The costs reductions from the process developed here will potentially be of considerable commercial value to existing cellulosic ethanol producers, as well as potentially to corn ethanol producers who may switch production methods if costs become comparable.

    This I-Corps project further develops a technology that stabilizes genomes of metabolically active yeast. A key step in cellulosic ethanol production, co-metabolism of five- and six-carbon sugars, can be achieved by yeast hybrids consisting of species that ferment one or the other carbon source. But yeast hybrids created by protoplast fusion are genetically unstable, being subject to rapid segregational loss of one or the other parental genome. Preliminary data indicate that genomic instability can be prevented by encapsulating hybrids in calcium alginate and can produce ethanol at near-theoretical yields for weeks on end. This technology has a wide variety of potential applications. It has already been used to study aging, and could be further used to improve plasmid retention in the production of diverse synthetic biology products, including insulin, anti-malarial drugs, and industrially important solvents and lubricants. Current research is focused on optimizing this method for cellulosic ethanol production, with plans in place to subsequently address these other markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the arena of energy-efficient solid state lighting. It has been estimated that 20% of all electricity generated in the US is for lighting purposes. Solid state lighting uses far less energy to produce the same amount of effective lighting than incandescent or fluorescent bulbs. Additionally, it neither poses the environmental risk of releasing elemental mercury, nor does it require restricted disposal as do compact fluorescent bulbs. Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) are more energy efficient and flexible than simple Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), which are made of brittle inorganic materials. OLEDs are >90% more efficient than incandescent light bulbs, and have the potential to be >98% more efficient. Therefore, OLED technology has the potential to dramatically reduce lighting costs and the associated electrical generation preventing the release of billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. OLED screens are steadily displacing other technologies used in portable, battery-operated devices such as cell phones, laptops, and tablets, and in TV's, airplane cockpits, and cars.

    This I-Corps project addresses a technological bottleneck for current OLED devices in the materials used for the generation of blue light. The materials currently in use have a fluorescent emission, which requires higher voltages resulting in greater energy consumption, more heat generation, and faster breakdown of the material in the device. Current manufacturers have adapted by using a layer of blue material that is twice the thickness of that in the red and green diode, which poses challenges for engineering the device structurally. The red and green diodes use a phosphorescent material requiring less voltage for generating the emission, thus, reducing energy consumption and heat generation. This project will evaluate the market potential of a new phosphorescent, true-blue emitting material for commercial applications that has greater thermal and chemical stability and is highly quantum efficient. During the project period, the team will gather information from OLED manufacturers to device makers to discern the need, cost-point, and interest for new raw materials, and how to fine tune the materials to better suit applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from robotics innovations that are applied to the health needs of over 17 million individuals in the United States of all ages who have walking related disabilities.   An innovative wheelchair attachment called Gait Rehab Adaptive Machine guides the user's legs through a therapeutic walking movement and drives the wheelchair.  This converts therapy into movement of the chair to give patients the opportunity to work on their own rehabilitation in a compelling way, all from a safely seated position.  The support of natural leg movement without the additional demand of load bearing and balance promotes muscle tone and blood circulation that are critical to organ health.  The connection to mobility promotes patient involvement, fitness, independence and well-being.  The system is instrumented to monitor daily performance.  This extends the reach of therapists to assist recovery from sports injuries, strokes and accidents. It also provides basic mobility for the elderly and walking disabled that promotes leg movement and exercise and it can provide valuable leg exercise in confined spaces such as during long distance airline flights.

    This I-Corps project explores commercialization of robotics technology that has resulted from new capabilities in computer-aided invention.  Given the requirements of the natural movement of the foot and leg of a patient, an articulated six-bar linkage skeleton that guides this movement was computed by evaluation of millions of alternatives and optimized to provide an effective mechanical system.  The result is low-cost versatile wheelchair attachment that connects to a patients legs and guides them through a therapeutic walking movement. This movement is coupled to the drive wheels of the wheelchair and converts their therapy into movement of the chair in all ways needed for daily life (forwards, backwards, and turning).   Mobility motivates increased therapeutic movement which increases its effectiveness.  The technology of computer-aided invention also ensures that the six-bar skeleton can be matched to the specific needs of individual users of various sizes as well as adjusted to provide specialized rehabilitation needs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the creation of a platform technology with a rapidly deployable, motorized arm that can be used wherever rapid, precise positioning of objects is required.  There are many potential medical, commercial, industrial, and consumer applications for the technology.  In the industrial sector there are needs to position and hold for assembly, soldering, gluing, welding, or metrology.  The device can also support needs for mechanical assistance during disassembly and re-assembly in maintenance operations.  Consumer applications include holding tablets, books, or laptops and adjustable workbench arms.  Medical applications include surgical retraction and surgical device or tool holding, including laparoscopic instruments.  The first target application in development is an abdominal surgical retraction system that can be deployed and/or adjusted within seconds.  A rapidly deployable retractor reduces operating room and anesthesia times.  Further, since the retractor arm is disposable, the risk of infection is reduced, and the need for cleaning, sterilization, and maintenance is eliminated.

    This I-Corps team has developed a device that consists of a motorized base with an attached flexible arm that can be locked into place and/or adjusted in seconds at the push and release of a button.  Various grippers can be attached to the end of the arm to firmly and steadily grasp or support an object at any orientation.  The speed and flexibility of these devices provide advantages over slower, manually operated fixtures, especially when working in and around complex geometries or fragile environments.  The intellectual property consists of a unique joint surface that permits the mechanical arm to be made much longer and stronger than competing systems.  A first generation system that operates as a surgical retractor was built and demonstrated before surgeons in mock scenario in a hospital operating room.  It was shown to be capable of providing adequate retraction force for abdominal surgeries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is substantial improvement of animal health and well-being, food safety, and public health through more effective and safe vaccines. Vaccination is a critical tool for the control of infectious diseases, and new vaccine technologies are needed to address challenges resulting from new emerging infectious diseases and increased restrictions on the use of antibiotics. They are essential for increasing global animal protein production to meet the demand of the growing human population. Nanoparticle-based vaccine adjuvant technology can enhance the performance and safety of vaccines used in food animals. The incorporation of this technology in licensed vaccines will improve animal health and well-being, help to reduce economic losses caused by infectious diseases, and decrease reliance on antibiotics. As many infectious diseases, like influenza, can be transmitted from animals to people, control of these diseases is also critical for the protection of public health.

    This I-Corps project is based on a new plant-derived nanoparticle adjuvant technology. Adjuvants are compounds that are added to vaccine formulations to enhance the protective immune response. Current vaccine adjuvants have a number of challenges including lack of efficacy with certain vaccine antigens, instability, non-biodegradable ingredients, and association with adverse effects. Nanoparticles are attractive candidates for new generation vaccine adjuvants, but many nanoparticles are synthesized chemically in the lab, expensive to produce, and difficult to scale up to meet the need of mass vaccinations. Certain varieties of plants have naturally occurring alpha-D-glucan nanoparticles that can be modified to give them immunostimulatory properties. The surface properties of the nanoparticles enables effective activation of immune cells, which contributes to the strong immune protection induced by the vaccines. The fact that the particles naturally exist in plants makes their preparation affordable and easy to scale up, and suitable for use in vaccines. In addition, the naturally occurring particles are stable in formulation, but biodegradable following injection minimizing possible adverse reactions associated with vaccine adjuvants.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a process technology that provides patients with a naturally pigmented donor skin scaffold (allograft) for recovery from surgeries, burns, and other procedures that require tissue regeneration.   The availability of a natural scaffold helps improve patient physiological outcomes, and the use of similar pigmentation can improve natural integration with the recipient's existing skin, easing their emotional recovery and self-image.  There is a growing demand for such engineered allografts in surgeries, including breast reconstruction. The incidence of breast cancer diagnosis has been increasing rapidly in the united states. Furthermore, the last few decades have seen an increasing trend for women to undergo a double mastectomy for preventative measures, even if breast cancer was only detected in one breast. Such procedures require complete reconstruction of both breasts. In 2015, there were 176,308 breast reconstructions and this number is expected to continue rising. This process technology will help meet some of this demand by improving the production of scaffolds, and may lead to new methods by which individuals planning surgeries can have their own tissue processed and reused in their procedures (autograft).

    This I-Corps project will develop a scaffold for nipple regeneration derived from human nipple areolar complex tissue. Currently, the best option for nipple reconstruction required in breast reconstruction is cutting and suturing the skin on the breast to create a scar mound with a subsequent tattoo for desired pigmentation that recreates the appearance of a nipple.  Unfortunately, this method results in nipple flattening due to retraction forces of the underlying tissue and contraction of scar tissue. Instead of just recreating the appearance of a nipple, like current reconstruction methods, our engineering process technology allows the patient to have a scaffold assist in the regeneration of a nipple made from her own cells. Portions of the scaffold processing we are developing have been demonstrated in a laboratory setting.   Advantages of this technology include improved cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration when the scaffold is repopulated with cells from the patient. It is highly desirable to maintain native tissue composition when engineering tissue scaffolds for regenerative medicine applications, and recent studies have demonstrated that superior function and complex tissue formation occurred when such scaffolds were derived from site-specific homologous tissues.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is focused on assessing and meeting the demand for a domestic source of high efficiency lithium ion batteries for custom electronic applications. The project investigates the commercialization potential of nanomaterial-enhanced high-performance lithium ion batteries for such applications as small satellites, remote sensing devices, and unmanned vehicle applications, where performance is paramount.  The desired use of these specific applications is often severely limited by the mass or volumetric energy density of commercial-of-the-shelf batteries.  Providing a rechargeable battery with improved energy density would enable longer missions, expanded sensing capability, and a larger communication range in these applications, and presumably a host of other portable electronic systems. An initial focus of the investigation with be within the U.S. defense and intelligence communities, whose use of such technologies has expanded dramatically over the past several years.  Successful commercialization of these batteries will provide the U.S. with improved protection and monitoring systems.

    This I-Corps project exploits the use of nanomaterials to enhance the performance of conventional lithium ion batteries. The project further develops energy dense lithium ion battery electrodes through the combination of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), high capacity active materials, and high areal capacity loadings.  This combination increases the relative mass of active to inactive materials that can store lithium in the cell, thus increasing its energy density.  In addition, the technology offers ancillary improvements in cycle life and suppression of the fading that occurs with increased charge/discharge rates.  This performance relies on the incorporation of CNTs as a conductive additive at a lower weight loading than conventional carbons, like carbon black and graphite, enabling improved mechanical properties and a more effective means of providing electrical percolation. The use of CNTs additives enables thicker electrodes, with more active material by volume, and a more efficient use of the active materials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it will introduce a new nanocarbon foam technology that can be utilized in multiple industrial applications. Initially the technology is expected to enhance the performance of thermal management products in electronics through the implementation of nanocarbon foams. Thermal management is critically important to many electronics and energy applications because ever-increasing generation of heat has become an impediment to the advancement and efficient operation of those devices. Thermal management devices made from nanocarbon foams could ensure enhanced performance of electronic devices by efficiently dissipating the high heat fluxes present in these devices. The lightweight, super-elastic, and high stability properties of nanocarbon foams make them a unique alternative for the thermal management of portable and flexible electronic devices.  In addition to thermal management, other applications of nanocarbon foams include use in electrodes for advanced batteries, in fuel cells, in pressure sensors, and in scaffolds for medical treatments.

    This I-Corps project focuses on potential applications of nanocarbon foams for thermal management. Nanocarbon foam is a carbon nanotube based all carbon porous material. It consists of large numbers of micro-scale cells and sub-micro thick walls with nano-scale pores. Because of their unique structures, the nanocarbon foams show high capillary pressure, super-absorption, large working fluid storage, and fast fluid transfer capabilities. They are also conductive, lightweight, stable, and flexible. These features allow nanocarbon foams to be a novel wick material for thermal management products and have a better performance than current wick materials. The simple and scalable fabrication process could lead to low cost and high quality device manufacturing. The goal of this project is to do focused customer discovery work in the electronics and thermal management industries to evaluate the commercial potential of nanocarbon foams.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in the broad field of electrically-safe, cold plasma technology. The specific application are quite broad in scope.  One potential commercial application area involves sterilization of medical instruments, food, and pharmaceutical products.  The system developed here is electrically safe for personnel and sensitive equipment used in manufacturing environments. Another potential application involves utilization of the cold plasma technology for medical treatment subject to strict electromagnetic interference requirements of other medical equipment in same surgical procedure. This project will explore the commercial potential of the core technology and will inform further technical developments and possible commercialization paths.

    This I-Corps project further develops a novel cold plasma technology, namely DC voltage driven cold plasma technology. Recent work has demonstrated that cold plasmas can be generated in self-oscillatory regime, when sequence of streamer-type breakdowns in gas flow is driven by purely DC high voltage. This approach differs from the traditional AC and pulsed-DC, where breakdown repetition rate is governed by the frequency of discharge driving voltage. The repetition frequency of the breakdowns in this innovative approach can be controlled by the geometry of discharge electrodes and surroundings. DC voltage driven cold plasma technology has tremendous fundamental advantages over the traditional AC and pulsed-DC systems including very effective mitigation of unwanted breakdowns and corona, elimination of electromagnetic interference, significant improvement of breakdown and electric shock safety, and overall simplicity of the system and enables multiple commercial applications.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this I-Corps project is wide reaching with potential applications for the naocomposites that range from active anode material for advanced batteries to electronic ink. Advanced batteries for electric vehicles can offer the opportunity to achieve longer range (reduce range anxiety), higher power solutions (for nimble acceleration and handling), increased range of operating temperatures (increased utility in colder climates). Similar improvements will impact portable electronics and power tools.  In all cases, but particularly in military and aerospace applications, low weight and longer lasting portable energy sources are critical, and batteries using materials with these characteristics will support important technological advances in these wide-ranging applications.  The batteries based on these technologies will likely have lower manufacturing cost compared to current technology.

    This I-Corps project further develops and explores the commercialization potential of a carbon and oxygen-based two-dimensional nanocomposite that has novel electronic properties (ranging from semi-conducting to conducting) and morphology (1:1-Carbon:oxygen ratio, layered structure, flexible).  This combination of properties can benefit applications where materials development is critical for future technological advances. In particular, these materials are made from non-toxic, abundant materials with controllable electronic properties and nanocomposite structure. Recent efforts in the lab have focused on scaling up the production quantity of these materials. This supports the idea that determining strategies for manufacturing scale-up can be achieved once the specific required properties, application and required quantities have been identified.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide an effective and low-cost means for inhibiting the growth of pathogenic or problematic bacteria in the environment. There is growing concern that the widespread use of antibiotics and biocides has promoted the evolution of resistant bacterial strains for which there exist few effective treatments. The proposed technology is being developed as a safer and more environmentally sustainable alternative to antibiotics and biocides, or may be used as part of a combination treatment to enhance their effects. Additionally, the proposed technology is selective, and can target specific bacteria within a population, thus preserving the function of beneficial species. Successful implementation of this project will lead to the development of a wide range of products useful for controlling bacteria in both built and natural environments. Specific applications are expected to include the control of agricultural pathogens, mitigation of petroleum reservoir souring, optimization of wastewater treatment processes, and microbiome engineering.

    This I-Corps project is based on a novel technology platform for the isolation and application of extremely wide host-range (polyvalent) bacteriophages (viruses that only infect bacteria). The vast majority of bacteriophages reported in scientific studies and developed for commercial use have had a narrow host-range, likely due to the use of biased isolation techniques. In contrast, the proposed technology preferentially isolates only very wide host-range bacteriophages. Polyvalent bacteriophages have the potential to be significantly more effective than narrow host-range bacteriophages at controlling target bacteria in many natural and built environments, including biofilms. They have been shown to be 10- to 100-fold more effective at inhibiting the growth of their target bacteria, and have been successfully utilized to eliminate 99.99% of an antibiotic resistance gene from a wastewater sample. When used in combination with antibiotics or biocides, the technology is expected to work synergistically, enabling long-term and more complete control of problematic bacteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be focused on improving design process efficiency for product development teams. This project will explore implementation of a web-based software that will be scalable, cost effective and comprehensive. Currently, many small to medium manufacturers cannot afford long-term simulation software due to high licensing and operating costs. To ensure durability, they rely heavily on a series of full-scale physical tests. Manufacturers who can afford existing software suites still utilize extensive physical testing, as simulation results are not solely adequate. This innovative technology allows for intelligent design changes and improvements to be implemented prior to prototyping and testing at an affordable rate for all manufacturers. This can significantly reduce the industry's reliance on physical testing, which can increase design time and product development costs.

    This I-Corps Project relies on an innovative relationship between the multi-scale hardness properties of a material and its long-term fatigue performance. By measuring the hardness of material, the technology can predict long-term product life. Currently, durability simulations are performed utilizing finite element analysis simulations and experimentally obtained material fatigue properties, neglecting important processing properties such as hardness and roughness. As a result, such simulations are often not accurate enough to predict the long-term performance of a product and thus necessitating physical testing for verification. The inclusion of processing parameters obtained through hardness testing in such simulation allows the designer to take into account many other contributing material factors and create a more robust and comprehensive simulation. This more accurate prediction of long-term product performance can drastically reduce the amount of physical testing necessary to verify a product is ready for the market. Using the multi-scale material properties from the hardness test, the proposed web-based software solution will be able to assist product engineers in design decisions regarding long term performance in any new or modified part.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies primarily in the enhancement of vaccine safety and efficacy. The project could potentially accelerate the development of safer and more cost-effective vaccines, and help transcend the current "safety-vs-efficacy" paradigm of current vaccine additive research. Given the escalating interest in immunomodulatory biologics from pharmaceutical companies, it is anticipated that these antibodies could enter the market at an opportune time from both regulatory and process development perspectives. Additionally, as the role of antibodies is becoming more fully elucidated in the field of immune-engineering, this antibody coating technology could also enhance treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases.

    This I-Corps project aims to explore the use of host (human) derived proteins as safe vaccine additives. Antibodies coat pathogens during the body's immune response to an infection, and these proteins may be able to enhance the immunogenicity of nanoparticulate or inactivated pathogen vaccines. Antibodies immobilized on the particles' surface would remain bound. Any non-immobilized, soluble antibody in the formulation should be recognized as host protein and consequently non-immunogenic, eliminating any off-target inflammatory effects such as those caused by soluble pathogen-derived vaccine additives.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project entails increasing the ability of commercial users of mass spectrometry to bring better products to market through the use of technology that better molecular identification and quantification. Commercial users of mass spectrometry include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, and other companies that have a direct impact on public health and wellbeing and are currently limited in social impact and revenue, in part, due to the inability to accurately identify and quantify molecules in mass spectrometry samples.  Specific applications for the technology includes research and development on a variety of products, including diagnostic tests, novel drugs, and personalized medicine.

    This I-Corps project will investigate the commercial delivery of mass spectrometry data processing services. The underlying technology advances current capabilities by combining advanced statistical methods, additional information present in mass spectrometry signals but not used by current approaches, and novel methods for interpretation to identify more molecules than current mass spectrometry approaches with more quantitative accuracy than current approaches. The research is particularly capable of detecting low abundance molecules, which are exceptionally difficult to detect with current methods, and are more likely to have biological significance than high abundance molecules. Corporate mass spectrometry users can use accurate identifications and quantifications of low abundance molecules to shorten time-to-market, reduce development costs, and increase the production throughput and significance of innovations across a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide K-12 schools with a learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training to expand and improve computer science education and to encourage a diverse student population to pursue further studies in computing. Computer science has become a core 21st century skill critical to careers both within and beyond the tech industry, but K-12 education has yet to meet increasing demand from industry and from parents to teach computing, and school districts still struggle to adequately train teachers and to engage students in computer science. This project provides a simple and easy-to-use solution that integrates music with computer science to drive student engagement. Moreover, this approach contributes to a diverse computer science pipeline by engaging female and minority students through an emphasis on creativity and real-world applications. Today there is a market for schools to train teachers, and to buy materials and tools to teach computer science.

    This I-Corps project leverages an online learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training designed for any introductory computing course from late elementary through to the college level, along with a body of research assessing the effects of this learning intervention on student content knowledge and engagement in computing. The web-based learning platform includes a code editor, a multi-track audio player, an audio loop library, an interactive textbook, and mechanisms for students to share and collaborate, along with curricular, training, and grading tools for teachers. Mixed-methods research has shown significant student gains in both content knowledge and engagement across gender and demographic groups when learning with this approach, with particularly large gains in engagement for female students. Students ascribe their increased engagement in computing to the creative, expressive, and real-world approach of the intervention through its combination of popular music and music production techniques with computational thinking and programming in industry-relevant coding languages.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is safely monitoring in real-time the condition of any surface that is affected by unwanted ice accumulation. Instead of using a time consuming and potentially dangerous visual inspection process, building and structure owners and operators can remotely assess icing conditions on any surface where ice could accumulate. Adopting this time and cost saving technology reduces the risk of the public and workers being harmed by falling ice, and also assists managers in making the appropriate operating decisions for icing mitigation measures such as activation of a deicing system.  Initial applications may include bridges, tall buildings, bus terminals, museums and other structures.

    This I-Corps project is a water phase sensor that determines the icing condition at a point on the surface of structure. When a structure goes through an icing cycle (ice accumulation, ice persistence and ice shedding), water changes phase from liquid to solid and back. When ice accumulates, water freezes on the surface which can be detected by the sensor. Before the ice sheds, water starts to appear beneath the ice layer. The sensor can also identify this water. This technology is the only point source surface mounted ice detector, and thus is distinguished from other technologies that do not attach on a surface and that utilize the weather conditions in the local area to predict the presence of ice on a surface. In addition, the other detection technologies utilize materials that are different from the material of the structure's surface. For these reasons, existing sensors may not provide a good representation of ice collecting on the actual surface of the structure. This sensor's accuracy, reliability, and durability have been demonstrated through laboratory and field tests. This testing includes three years of deployment in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a platform for facilitated deployment of interactive automated messaging services called chatbots, that can be configured by non-technical personnel. There is a broad community consensus that the chatbots have become one of the recent major mobile application trends. Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversations with human users, especially over various messaging channels including plain texting and instant messaging over the Internet. There exists a need in developing platforms to facilitate chatbots deployments for broader use. The innovation can be useful to any business which has many customers and can save communication resources by delegating routine conversations to an automated interactive messaging system. The potential commercial impact of this tool will be significant for both saving time and money by reducing administrative burdens.

    This I-Corps project will explore commercial feasibility of a flexible generic chatbot service which can be programmed, operated and managed by non-technical personnel for fast and inexpensive deployments. By using dedicated menus, the system operators will program their protocols by adding user-specific variables, uploading messages and their triggering/scheduling conditions, setting messaging channels, linking to external data sources and destinations. The proposed system will automatically integrate all the messages and their triggering conditions in a conflict-free protocol flow on the background and will allow the operator to check and observe the protocol execution flow in time by simulation. The proof-of-concept prototype is already used in two health-promotion projects and the team members gain valuable experience. This approach provides more flexibility and conditioned cycling options than existing solutions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the displacement of many battery applications with an alternative technology based on a Thin Flexible Fuel Cell (TFFC). Initial target markets include the many applications in which long-life, compactness and high performance are important. Based on the needs for portable storage filled by batteries at present, a technology that increases lifetimes between charging by ten times will impact multiple applications including smartphones, tablets, test equipment, medical instruments, and small autonomous vehicles.  The result will be greater flexibility and versatility imparted to the various systems impacted, and greater utility and benefit to their users.

    This I-Corps project leverages a recent discovery in hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Thin Flexible Fuel Cell (TFFC). The structural components of the TFFC are constructed completely from soft materials, rather than rigid and more dense metals, plastics or composites. The result is that the device is ultra-thin (< 1 mm), sheet-like, and may be bent into almost any arbitrary shape. It is also extremely light and has among the highest recorded power densities on a mass or volume basis for compact, air-breathing, fuel cells.  The fuel cell was discovered through research on the implementation of low-cost two-dimensional device fabrication involving nano-imprint lithography. The device was found to have five times the power density (W/kg) of state-of-the-art commercially available ultra-light, compact fuel cells. Moreover, the TFFC is completely passive with respect to oxygen supply and thermal management, needing no extra sub-systems for these functions.

    to improve safety and minimize equipment maintenance costs. In healthcare, equipment
    malfunctions are a major patient safety issue because of direct patient care impact,
    and also due to equipment maintenance costs in general. The technology developed
    here monitors the health of biomedical equipment asset with the purpose of predicting,
    in real-time, biomedical equipment asset failure in order to reduce the rate of
    equipment failure, thereby, improving safety and reducing costs. This project
    will equip healthcare and military facilities with a tool to better manage their
    assets, eradicate equipment downtime, reduce maintenance cost and eliminate unanticipated
    failures. The added benefit of the commercial potential of this project comes
    from the opportunity for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of equipment
    assets to improve their technologies with the condition-based maintenance strategy
    that this innovation offers. \n\nThis I-Corps project seeks to develop a low-cost,
    power-efficient, wireless, mesh-networked family of microprocessors, sensors and
    software designed to give real-time reporting on equipment status and offer condition-based
    maintenance schedules. The instrumentation innovation is the combination of different
    sensors to capture periodic data on pressure, temperature, humidity, position,
    current and vibration on an equipment asset for condition-based maintenance of
    the asset. This project will be based on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the connection
    and management of different assets in a healthcare facility or military materiel
    supply chain. This project will develop a template for the integration of mesh
    radio frequency identification (RFID) of emitted but encrypted radio frequency
    (RF) signals in conformance to IEEE 802.15.4 standards over the 2.4 GHz industrial,
    scientific, and medical (ISM) radio band. The device will be used in conjunction
    with the cloud where data will be processed in a wireless configuration. Coupled
    with the development of this module is a dynamic data analytic procedure that
    incorporates novel machine learning statistical routines for maintenance forecasts."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the development of a technology that measures the function of enzymes, called GTPases. GTPases are molecular on/off switches that control normal cell function and many aspects of health and disease. Current technology only measures the activity of a single GTPase at a time and is labor intensive. High costs further hinder routine laboratory or clinical analyses. A new technology for rapid and sensitive measurements of multiple GTPases in cells or tissues can revolutionize diagnostics and patient response to therapy. Potential commercial clients for the technology include clinical laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, and diagnostic kit manufacturers. Clients will be able to distinguish life-threatening conditions that require different treatments or determine drug treatment efficacy within hours instead of days. A 4- to 10-fold lower cost of sample analysis is an added potential benefit.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercialize potential of a new technology and make it broadly available for scientific discovery and clinical applications. The project further develops a technology that measures changes in cell or tissue GTPase enzyme function. Individual GTPases turn on and off in response to external cues that include microbes, disease, drugs and toxins. Coated beads capture active GTPases present in cells or body fluids. A common clinical laboratory instrument, called a flow cytometer, measures captured proteins on the beads. The technology enables drug discovery, diagnostics, and molecular discovery. A numerical readout makes it easy to monitor changes in GTPase activities due to experimental treatments over time and in small samples. Rapid screening of medications that can block disease processes speeds drug discovery. Bringing these innovative capabilities to the commercial market will significantly improve discovery output in academia and industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is creating computer-aided classification methods to better identify and distinguish various diseases. Skin issues are the most frequently addressed issues presented in primary care: over one-third of primary care visits include at least one skin problem. Skin issues are visual manifestations of many different types of diseases, including allergies, injuries, bacterial infections, viral infections, and hormonal fluctuations. A physician's ability to address skin issues is highly dependent on a physician's prior visual training experiences. However, many physicians are not regularly familiar with the over 2,000 dermatology issues that can arise in a patient. The algorithms developed here allow for objective and much more accurate screening of exposed skin to improve evaluation of patient issues in many different care settings. This could be implemented for many different types of skin diseases and other visual constructions of images to assist physicians visually and vastly augment their sensitivity and specificity at identifying dermatology issues and their underlying causes.

    This I-Corps project is based on using image processing and machine learning to distinguish dermatological diseases. Image-capturing electronics such as consumer-grade cameras and smartphones are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, capable, and affordable. Image processing and machine learning based on annotated images has shown great potential for algorithms to differentiate between images capturing different objects and patterns. The developments here have created a classification system that differentiates suspicious from non-suspicious lesions that is easy for a physician to use in a clinical setting to help with clinical decision-making. The proof of concept is based on a large dataset of prospective clinical images where the algorithms classified malignant cases and the methods resulted in a statistically significant discrimination between suspicious and non-suspicious lesions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the I-Corps project is the development of a prototype geodetic satellite-based gravity observational system and the associated cloud-based computing tools for the rapid remote monitoring of floods, droughts, and freshwater resources availability globally at basin scales. The project is expected to enable efficient, dynamic, big data quantifications of freshwater transport for a wide range of potential commercial applications. The potential commercialization of this tool and the timely availability of the associate data products could provide critical information and impact on commercial applications including precision agriculture, disaster planning and management, as well as general water resources management.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization of a cloud-based satellite temporal gravity observation processing and visualization tool.  This is designed for rapid monitoring with up to daily temporal sampling for natural or anthropogenic features.  The project builds from prior developments improving the temporal resolution of water storage change and potentially improving its spatial resolution.  Current commercially available tools for agricultural and disaster/water resources management services are primarily based on passive remote sensing imaging which are typically limited by cloud cover or are prohibitively expensive for acquiring timely data sets.  As Earth satellite gravity mission data sets continue into the next decade, the data underpinning this work is freely available and potentially updated in near real time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable safe integration of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) into the broader power network, as well as to reduce PEV charging costs for drivers. If unmanaged, PEVs would represent major extra loads for utilities, which would increase energy peak consumption and require considerable investment to upgrade grid infrastructure. The technology developed here involves a smart charging software, which will enable real time communication between PEV fleets and utilities, and will remotely control PEV charging to provide grid regulation services. This project will bridge the gap between the automotive industry and the energy industry, and will develop strategies to create a smart and connected ecosystem around PEV charging. Successful commercialization of the smart charging software could result in lower PEV cost of ownership, and increased penetration of clean transportation in the US.

    This I-Corps project is based on an advanced, adaptive, optimization framework for Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) charging control in power networks. The technique can control PEV charging under conditions of general uncertainty, and consider both driver mobility constraints and power network constraints. The optimization framework is particularly adapted to large fleets of PEVs and shows fast convergence rate and privacy preserving properties. The method uses past PEV data to predict travel behaviors and energy demand. It also models distribution grid constraints and electricity market structure to set relevant optimization objectives. The method utilizes a range of optimization methods and selects the best algorithm based on tradeoff between optimality, constraint satisfaction and computation time. The methods include partial differential equation aggregation techniques for car sharing fleets, plug-and-play model predictive control for power networks with high congestion, and dual-splitting methods for large scale residential fleets with lower computation capabilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be engineering a new silicon-based cost-effective, precise, mechanical chip technology to perform gene knockdowns and editing at the single-cell level.  The technology will enable this on a parallel scale as well as the eventual applicability to T cell immunotherapy. The ability to target and profile specific genes and pathways in single cells with a nanoneedle-based microrobotic device will constitute a major technological advance that will enable researchers to monitor cancer progression, study the- underlying mechanisms and develop therapeutic T cell engineering. The technology is primarily addressing a fundamental problem associated with cell and gene therapy: viruses used to program cells before transplant into the body provoke undesirable immune response, may cause adverse effects as viral DNA integrates into the human genome, involve costly production and lengthy protocols, and can typically only be used once. This technology will enable an alternative engineering solution to this fundamental therapeutic problem which can eliminate such toxicity issues encompassing major applications in other areas including livestock, industrial biology, agriculture, drug discovery and development.

    This I-Corps project will further develop a technology that allows editing of single T cells with high transduction efficiency and minimal invasiveness. Parameters such as target efficiency, sensitivity/specificity of manipulation and delivery, device functionality after repetitive transduction, uniformity of manipulation across different single cells, as well as precision, reproducibility, hysteresis and stability of the motion of the microrobotic actuator will be optimized. The silicon-based microrobotic actuator is designed such that it can accurately track and target desired positions within single cells under an open loop control without a position feedback sensor, thus avoiding complicated control system electronics. A platform has been developed that includes a microrobotic actuator, which consists of a microstage driven by capacitive components that moves in 3D using an electrostatic field responsible for the independent motion to the nanoneedles. The key innovative concept here is to integrate the parallel architecture based 3D actuator technology with multiple nanoneedle biosensors so that each of them can be independently moved for targeted single-cell manipulation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from its data intelligence approach to empower electronic design automation. The semiconductor industry provides vital hardware backbone of the information technology age through an extremely wide range of integrated circuits (ICs) in computing devices and consumer electronics.  Modern IC development process is bottlenecked by growing chip design complexity, e.g. measured by large device count and functionality diversity, and ever-demanding requirements on computing performance and power/energy efficiency. Advanced IC manufacturing processes are costly, and yet have unavoidable process variations, making fabricated chips susceptible to failures. With its revenue reaching $7.8 billion in 2015, the electronic design automation (EDA) industry supplies indispensable tools and methodologies that make IC design possible. The potential market and societal impact of the proposed EDA innovation is substantial. This technology can help semiconductor and chip design companies develop integrated circuits of improved performance and robustness with a reduced time-to-market and development cost.

    This I-Corps project demonstrates novel machine learning algorithms targeting electronic design automation. As the complexity of integrated circuits scales up rapidly, the need for smart design tools is prominent. The EDA industry is in the early phase of rapid integration of machine learning algorithms into commercial IC design flows. The learning methods focused in this project significantly improve the accuracy of statistical regression and classification over the current-state-of-the-art, and offer the much needed understanding of the underlying structure of the data. Built upon the focused machine learning algorithms, the targeted EDA technology can efficiently process simulation or measured performance data of existing chip designs, and intelligently learn the complex hidden relationships between performance specifications, design parameters, and manufacturing conditions. As a result, it offers a powerful data science solution to IC design optimization, verification, and debug.   Implemented as high-performance parallel software design tools, the technology will bring the power of machine learning to the field of electronic design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop autonomous navigation technology that will enable systems to robustly operate in uncertain environments without a Global Positioning System (GPS). The project is a result of a confluence of astronomy, aerospace, computational science and artificial intelligence. Commercialization of this technology has the potential to revolutionize space exploration, self-driving cars, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and other such systems which need accurate position estimation. A key advantage of this project's technology is enhanced cybersecurity as it does not rely on external signals for navigation. Further, this project will contribute open-source software to the scientific community. It is envisioned that development of a software toolbox that integrates with the popular ROS (Robot Operating System) library will allow researchers to simulate autonomous navigation without GPS.

    This I-Corps project is a result of research into the problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). In SLAM, a robot is not given prior knowledge of its environment, it must use its sensory data and actions to simultaneously build a map of its environment and position itself within its uncertain map. Competing methods in this area exhibit positioning errors which may be unsuitable for long-term navigation. The work developed here shows that by fusing orientation sensing with short-range sensing, the system attain a simplification of the underlying optimization problem. This allows fast and globally optimal solutions. In this approach, a vehicle uses a camera to track celestial bodies in the sky which allows the vehicle to estimate its orientation in space, this information is fused with short-range sensors such as lasers and cameras which track features in vicinity of the vehicle.  Using the proposed approach, a system can achieve 100x improvement in position error over existing methods.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to transform health, wellness, and disease assessment and monitoring by developing a simple, cost-effective method of exhaled air analysis. This technology can be used in diverse scenarios, including in the hospital, primary care settings, in the field, and directly by the end-user. The long term potential impact of this technology is the ability to collect physiological measurements frequently, non-invasively, and deliver results instantaneously. Infrequent measurements or delays in diagnostic results can lead to avoidable morbidity, mortality, and direct emergency/terminal care costs. This technology is capable of addressing unmet monitoring and diagnostic needs in a wide variety of clinical and health & wellness applications, representing a multibillion dollar value creation opportunity impacting stakeholders throughout the value chain.

    This I-Corps project aims to develop a technology platform that will enable accurate and cost effective breath gas analysis at the point-of-care.  The breath test is made possible by carbon nanotube chemiresistor sensor scheme and device integration advancements. This project has a novel approach to selective detection of gases at part-per-billion concentrations using a smartphone and near field communication tags modified with a simple two-step process. The technology platform consists of a circuit design, data transfer method, fabrication process, and chemiresistor formulations to enable molecularly-specific detection of biomarkers at biologically relevant (part-per-billion) concentrations in exhaled breath.  This technology produces a chemically-specific, concentration-dependent electrical output without compromising on the pattern recognition benefits of 'electronic nose' solutions. This work may also yield general advancements in chemical sensor performance optimization and thin-film electronics roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques.

    The broader impacts and commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce the complications and failures of dental implants. Treatment planning a critical part of the dental implant treatment process. With more than 6 million dental implants placed per year in the US there is growing need for improved treatment planning processes.  This need is enhanced by the increased adoption of dental implants as a procedure performed by general dentists who had traditionally referred such cases to specialists. Inadequate treatment planning is recognized as the single biggest cause of implant failure, which presents an unnecessary health risk for the patient.  The adoption of this treatment planning tool will enable greater confidence among both practitioners and patients of dental implant treatments.

    This I-Corps project develops a novel smart health platform that generates dental implant treatment plan considering the factors required for the successful execution of treatment. The system considers pertinent medical information, information about the tooth intended to be replaced, the available anatomical spaces, the quality of soft tissue of the patient and information about the patient?s oral habits. Research-based algorithms correlate the amount of bone remaining, space available and the type of implant to be used. After assessing the data received, the platform provides an analysis of possible outcomes and, if appropriate, a proposed treatment plan including the type of surgery recommended, the type of implant, and if there is any supplementary surgeries needed to be performed, such as bone or gum grafts. The software will also recommend healing times and post-operative care guidelines for the practitioner that are specifically customized to the patient.  This technology combines all the factors which directly affect the osseointegration of the dental implant, the bone-implant surface interaction and the response of the soft-tissue of the patient to the treatment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in the core technology's ability to establish a new paradigm for oil spill cleanup that employs on-demand manufacturing of absorbent structures customized to match the specific properties of the oil to be collected. Oil spills are typically expensive to remediate due to the equipment, time, and manpower required. Consequently, most remediation approaches are focused on large-scale spill events.  However, these account for only approximately 5% of the total pollution in waterways. Small-scale spills occur much more frequently but are often ignored because existing cleanup technologies are inefficient to deploy. The 3D printed oil absorbent technology to be explored in this project uniquely address this need by delivering customized absorbent capacity and the ability to be produced on-demand to maximize recovery for a broad range incidents via customization toward the unique combination of oil properties, quantity, and environmental and weather conditions at each spill site.

    This I-Corps project seeks to explore the commercial potential of a family of 3D printable oleophilic materials capable of absorbing and retaining oil within specially designed internal pore networks. These absorbent materials also leverage shape memory behavior, making it possible for the absorbed oil to be extracted and recovered by heating the material to a prescribed temperature at which it automatically contracts to squeeze out the collected oil. In this way, the absorbent materials can be made to function like a self-wringing sponge. These materials are produced using poly(lactic acid), an inexpensive commodity biopolymer that is degradable and environmentally friendly. This technology emerged from fundamental research performed in a prior NSF-sponsored project, where optimal pore network designs and processing conditions were identified to maximize recovery of different petroleum samples dispersed in water. 3D printing enables on-demand production of designer absorbent architectures that match properties of different petroleum fractions, maximize selectivity against water, and permit either strong encapsulation or easy recovery of the collected oil.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is catalyzing the shift from mobile to spatial computing through enabling Augmented Reality (AR) technology.  AR has a broad impact across many use cases such as instruction, visualization, and entertainment.  AR offers an intuitive visualization that decreases the cognitive overhead for the user, thus providing an environment with less manufacturing mistakes, better-visualized parts, or real-time data visualizations for example.  Such technology enhances the abilities of people by showing the relevant information when it is needed to the user. This context-aware visualization tool offers a personalized experience in a way that brings digital content into the physical world in an intuitive, spatially consistent manner. This growing new technology has the potential to change how people interact with digital content in the physical world.

    This I-Corps project addresses the problem of estimating a partially observable three-dimensional manifold in conjunction with a full 6-degree of freedom pose from inertial measurements and sequential two-dimensional luminescent representations of semi-static observations - a fundamental problem for Augmented Reality (AR).  Inertial observations alone provide minimal uncertainty for up to a tenth of a second using commercially available and ubiquitous hardware, thus limiting the accuracy pose estimation and, for practical long-term applications, necessitating visual input to be jointly fused in.  This project focuses on ubiquitous handheld computing platforms, inducing resource constraint considerations for both accuracy and human interface experiences.  Further computational considerations need to be made for enabling parallel application-specific processes, thus further limiting available resources.

Stress alone is responsible for up substantial healthcare costs in the U.S. Similarly, good mental health is associated with improved creativity, inspiration and mental clarity, improved relationships and reduced anxiety, improved collaboration and increased employee loyalty. This project aims to explore the commercial potential of including objective cognitive assessment as part of healthcare and wellness programs. Users would be monitored for signs of psychological distress and if detected, an intervention such as therapy, coaching or training would be suggested in order to minimize the impact of distress in its early stages. Objective cognitive assessment can have an impact on the overall productivity of employees and is likely to increase the mental capital of the organization.

    This I-Corps project is based on electroencephalography (EEG) aided assessment of cognitive function and builds on decades of cognitive evaluation research, recent developments of biomedical signal acquisition and processing, and expertise in statistical analyses, data science, and machine learning. The proposed technology expands prior developments of both research and clinical devices for recording brain activity in diverse settings including emergency rooms, sports fields, military and aerospace. The technology also directly builds on experience with quantifying cognitive state of a person in a wide range of settings such as exercise, cognitive processing, and communication. Furthermore, it builds on a decade long efforts in cognitive assessment in animal models of epilepsy, schizophrenia, intellectual disability and autism.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is focused on improving occupational safety for workers during the collection and transfer of potentially infectious or contaminated fluids such as umbilical cord blood or environmental water to test tubes for transportation to the laboratory. This fluid collection and transfer technology reduces fluid splash and splatter during fluid collection and eliminates the need for a needle and syringe system during transfer thereby eliminating haphazard and dangerous methods currently in use. These procedures are thereby rendered safer by reducing the risk of potentially infectious fluid exposures and by reducing the risk of needle stick injuries. There is considerable commercial opportunity due to the intensity of interest in improving the occupational safety of staff and personnel involved in the large number of fluid collection and transfer procedures taking place daily.

    This I-Corps project proposes to develop an inexpensive and safe technology for collecting and transferring potentially infectious or contaminated fluids to test tubes. The system consists of a collection vessel with a wide opening to easily collect fluids from various sources and a guide tube assembly (consisting of a guide tube with a recessed needle installed) which is clipped into to the vessel. Laboratory tubes are filled with fluid in the vessel in a clean, quick, efficient and safe manner by inserting the laboratory tube into the guide tube.  As a result, the worker can complete the procedure without the need for removing the stopper from the vacuum tube (reducing mess and contamination) and without the need for an exposed needle (reducing risk of percutaneous injury). This project is focused on workers involved in these commonplace fluid transfer procedures and the administrative staff concerned with protecting these workers and reducing liability (and cost) for their institutions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in fabrication of improved structures for use in harsh environments. The core technology was originally developed for inexpensive heat shields for space vehicles.  It can now be used for complex heat exchangers or for hot-section components for aviation and power generation engines, or for radiation resistant liners in nuclear applications. In all these applications, the proposed technology can reduce the original equipment cost while improving performance and reliability, or can be used to reduce replacements cost of original metal-based components. When applied to aviation or power generation, the net benefit can in the form of lower emissions from the engines, and lower cost of flying or lower electricity cost due to both lower fuel cost and lower maintenance cost. As the underlying manufacturing technology has significant overlap with that for polymer composite structures such as boat hulls or wind turbines, manufacturing personnel employed in such traditional industries can be easily retrained for manufacturing of high-value added, hot-section components for capital goods such as gas turbine engines for aviation and power generation.

    This I-Corps Project focuses on potential applications of a relatively new type of high-temperature structural materials, known as Polymer Derived Ceramic Composite (PDCC). PDCC fabrication is inexpensive as it involves similar fabrication techniques as other polymer composite structures like wind turbine blades or boat hulls. However, ceramic fiber and special resin are to be used for PDCC. Currently available resin-fiber combinations offer maximum use temperatures between 1200C and 1700C, depending on the choice of ceramic fibers. This maximum use temperature is much higher than creep-onset temperatures of common high-temperature alloys.  The PDCC process is significantly less inexpensive compared to many monolithic ceramics or alternative ceramic matrix composite processes.  Also, use of appropriate molds during formation of the polymeric state can lead to relatively complex shapes. PDCC?s share the typical properties of other ceramics, such as corrosion resistance or radiation tolerance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve overall health through on-body biomedical monitoring.  Although this study focuses on a wearable textile material for use specifically in cutaneous sensing applications, these same materials will have broader implications for public health since they can be used for a variety of sensing or device applications.  The materials developed in this work could be functionalized for the detection of a wide variety of biomarkers and such innovations could profoundly impact our ability to diagnosis, treat, and prevent diseases, from analysis of common diabetic neurological complications to the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF).  These materials could also be used in smart clothing to allow for biomonitoring in advanced prosthetic limb applications, bedridden patients, or athlete performance tracking. Development of a wearable sensing material capable of determining physiological parameters at the surface of skin could also make construction of health monitoring sensor arrays relatively easy and inexpensive.

    This I-Corps project is based on innovative, textile-based sensing materials capable of continuous monitoring of biomarkers in sweat, which could have significant impact on the field of biomedical monitoring.  These sensing materials would be better than current sensors as they could provide continuous information about a person's health based on a molecular level analysis of sweat biomarkers in a flexible, lightweight device that could be worn in any application without discomfort.  This technology can provide reliable, real-time monitoring of dehydration (sodium ions), muscle fatigue (lactic acid), and temperature in cutaneous sweat.  These sensors are made of functionalized carbon nanotube nanocomposites with an electrospun polymer base.  One sensor, using a polypyrrole functionalization, has been demonstrated to measure temperature in a physiologically relevant range (25-45 degrees Celsius).  Selective nanocomposite materials functionalized with calixarene can selectively measure sodium ions in synthetic sweat, without ionic interference; while, nanocomposite materials functionalized with lactate oxidase have been demonstrated to selectively measure lactic acid without glucose interference.  The data collected from the developed sensor could lead to better understanding of health and disease processes, leading to better treatments and health outcomes for all patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide technologies and services based on models of speech signals and human speech perception. These models incorporate a deep understanding of the physical speech stimulus and the perceptual representations that drive speech perception.  Technology applications to be explored can break new ground in areas such as: (1) Improving the efficacy of audiological testing; (2) Improving the realism of computer-synthesized voices (3) Providing speech perception training for better understanding of non-native speakers or speakers with neurological disorders; (4) Enhancing multisensory speech perception through training of individuals with audiovisual speech processing deficits such as individuals on the autism spectrum; (5) Developing sensory substitution or augmentation through vibrotactile stimuli; and (6) Improving the quality of older adults? lives through visual speech perception training to ameliorate their declines in perceiving auditory speech in noisy backgrounds.

    This I-Corps project will investigate commercial applications of technologies and services based on models of multisensory speech signals and human speech perception.  Human speech perception can be highly errorful in the presence of noise and/or distortions that originate in the talker, the physical communication channel, and/or the perceiver (e.g., hearing loss). The technology to be explored models how speech perception degrades, and how multisensory stimuli compensate for perceptual errors. For example, this technology supports the characterization of speech perception difficulties using a simple talk-back task in which the perceiver repeats what was just said. In formal laboratory experiments, this technology has been used to improve speech perception training outcomes through improvements in the contingencies between perceptual errors and training feedback. This technology can be used in developing media that are designed to reduce the potential for perceptual errors.

    The broader impact and/or commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to implement a software package can improve aircraft designs, especially for high altitude, high wind speed conditions.  Aircraft design is interdisciplinary, and important considerations include aerodynamic load computations and external surface design. There are many physical factors and parameters that must be considered in different design stages, such as, 1). Fast conceptual or preliminary designs with approximate parameter estimations; 2). Prototype development; 3) Optimizations. An improved development of an aircraft design can create many benefits, e.g., optimal control surfaces can enhance maneuverability; save long term airplane operation cost; and improve the missile strike accuracy.  This software package offers fast and accurate estimations on different performances from the size, geometry, numbers, and locations of small aircraft control surfaces.  The package can help aerospace design engineers to perform fast preliminary designs with correct inclusions of physical parameters as well as to perform accurate computations for late stage optimizations. The product may significantly reduce demands on labor, time, space, materials and devices compared to current design methods.

    This I-Corps project further develops an improved Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling software based on groups of air molecules and their collective behaviors.  This overcomes limitations of most CFD packages, which assume dense gas flows, when applied to high altitude applications where air is dilute and rarefication effects should be considered. The process developed here also overcomes typical limitations of single molecule dynamics where the simulation results are accurate but slow, making them impractical for most engineering applications. The simulation techniques developed here can be fast and have rarefication effects properly included.  By using this proposed software packages, accurate databases can be established, with many combinations of size, shape, locations, and number of control surfaces.  Interpolation functions will be incorporated in the package as well to further increase the computation speed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is reducing energy cost in future buildings and communities, and improving grid operations. Specifically,  this project can benefit society by providing: 1) a software and hardware packaged solution for future smart buildings and communities; 2) the opportunity to save energy and money by reducing utility bills; 3) enabling technology for the next generation of proactive buildings. With the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources such as photovoltaic systems, electric vehicles, and battery energy storage systems at the individual building level, electrical load patterns becomes uncertain and variable, contributing to grid instability and energy waste. At the grid level, the introduction of renewable energy also makes the power system status more uncertain and variable, which requires more ancillary services to ensure system supply adequacy and reliability. Thus, the need for ancillary service provisions will increase substantially, and utility will require more flexible loads.

    This I-Corps project will 1) conduct customer and user interviews and investigate the broader needs of the technology to verify product value proposition; 2) conduct analysis based on customer needs through face to face meetings with customers and users in 1); and 3) develop business plan based on customer interviews and value proposition validation. The proposed technology is an innovative hardware and software solution for buildings that includes modeling of occupancy behavior patterns, forecasting solar energy generation and building energy demand, and predictive controlling smart energy devices through the incorporation of dynamic grid signals. These innovative energy-efficient technologies show a clear application to both residential and commercial buildings in the future. Based on previous research outcomes, a software platform has been developed that demonstrated significant energy cost saving capability  in both residential and commercial buildings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable widespread adoption of electric vehicle (EV) technologies.  The project is line with the requirements for breakthrough battery technologies articulated by the US Department of Energy "EV Everywhere Grand Challenge" as well as the specific goals in the  U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium's "EV 2020", 25% lower cost, 2x higher performance. Although Li-ion technology is currently used in relatively low volume production plug-in hybrid and niche high performance vehicles, the technological goals required to enable truly mass adoption of EV are likely beyond the capabilities of Li-ion. Several advanced battery technologies have been under development but there has been no successful example of commercialization directly into the large mobility space. As such, identification of a viable stepping stone market strategy is paramount for commercialization of a new battery technology.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization potential for a Ceramic Solid-state Battery. This project furthers develops a scalable, low-cost, bulk-scale solid-state batteries using superionic conducting oxides. The work builds from research on a superionic conducting oxide membrane technology exhibiting unique breakthrough materials properties. Current progress demonstrates that bulk-scale ceramics processing of these materials is feasible. The solid-state construction and materials chemistry allows for compatibility with Li metal resulting in 2x energy density compared to Li-ion. A manufacturing scheme is being developed which utilizes conventional manufacturing tools and eliminates the need for dry room processing with a path forward to cost structures lower than competing Li-ion technologies. While these features can broadly add value in several industrial sectors, successful commercialization of a battery technology requires accurate identification of a viable beachhead market so a go-to market strategy can be developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to make it easier for novices to learn electronics and computing concepts making these disciplines more available, accessible, and inclusive. The prevalence and advances in embedded technology are spurring increasing need for trained STEM employees to create Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, electronics and computing are difficult to learn and the interventions that exist often result in an underrepresentation of women and minorities. The educational technology in this project addresses these needs through learning materials designed to engage a diversity of students through experiential educational experiences that can integrate into a variety of contexts to educate students through design of computational objects. The project focuses on broadening participation and improving student learning outcomes through curriculum, technology, and a support system that provides tools that account for the needs of students with varying skill levels, while offering students non-traditional pathways into computing and engineering.

    This I-Corps project builds on work in physical computing education, focusing on the design and development of tools to facilitate learning about electronics and computing concepts as students build engaging projects. The literature in physical computing is dominated by informal educational interventions and has yet to understand how to improve the tools and learning activities to address the needs of teachers and students. This project will begin to investigate the needs of the various stakeholders within formal education to understand how to reach the broad range of students in public high schools. Furthermore, our modular educational technology brings clarity to the programmable electronics by focusing on visibility of the signals within the circuits, while promoting interactions that focus the learner to encounter important concepts. By shedding light on the interactions between the hardware and software, the tools facilitate students in understanding how the embedded Internet of Things (IoT) technology works.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to deliver a low cost mastering technology to enable the cost-effective pattering of polymer and other surfaces to impart function without the use of chemical additives.  The masters will be used in microreplication, injection molding and embossing to impart structural color, antimicrobial activity, anti-counterfeiting marks, light collection for solar energy and other surface functionality with high yield and high throughput, impacting consumer products and technology companies alike.  The use of surface patterns as opposed to chemical additives to achieve function offers environmental and consumer safety advantages and is resource and energy efficient.

    This I-Corps project employs a fundamentally new approach to the fabrication of master molds for patterning polymer surfaces via microreplication and nanoreplication technologies including injection molding, nanoimprint lithography, and embossing.  Master molds are typically produced via optical lithography and etching of rigid substrates including silicon wafers, stainless steel and quartz, which is expensive as well as time and resource intensive.  This is a novel process for direct imprinting of dimensionally stable crystalline metal oxide nanostructures that are fabricated using soft lithography with inks comprised of crystalline nanoparticles. Via this process it is possible to create a soft daughter mold from a single parent master and use that soft mold to create successive generations of high fidelity, robust masters in crystalline zirconia and other metal oxides, substantially reducing cost.  In addition the use of zirconia patterns on thermally robust master substrates enables pattern transfer at temperatures far above those accessible using conventional masters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will benefit news and broad media consumers, as well as the publishing and printing industries. The project augments print publications with digital interactive media content, both curated and created collaboratively by users. Media rich reading experience will enhance interest in reading and news media consumption. The data obtained during the project may lead to new approaches on engaging different audiences with news media consumption. The project?s commercial impact stems from extending the viability of print media communication industry by both improving reader retention and increasing circulation. A larger audience and the ability to closely target a market based on hard data increases revenue from advertising. Corporations and their advertising agencies will benefit by providing more relevant advertising to end users, delivering more impact per dollar spent.

    This I-Corps project uses Augmented Reality to integrate multiple information channels including both physical print and digital media. The digital media assets are hosted on a server and accessed by users through an adaptive interface that selectively displays controls based on the available content and user preferences. Scanned publication pages are classified using a machine learning algorithm trained on a document database and further identified using image matching to allow necessary efficiency and precision. The system collects usage data and interaction history to learn about reading habits and media interaction. These data are used for analytics and also as an input for the image matching workflow. The prototype was developed using iterative user-centered design and tested in experiments for preferred functionality and user experience.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a superior methos for the treatment for dry eye syndrome. Dry eye affects tens of millions of people in the United States alone. The symptoms of dry eye are vast and varied however even mild symptoms are detrimental to one's quality of life. Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is the most common contributor to dry eye, and the current treatment options are either ineffective, inconvenient, or extremely expensive. The technology developed here is a device that supplies superior effectiveness and convenience over current treatment options. The introduction of a device with these superior aspects has an opportunity to deter the progression of dry eye syndrome and thus decrease the cost to both patients and the healthcare market as a whole. The goal of developing a convenient and effective MGD treatment option creates an opportunity to be a leader in the $3 billion dry eye market and relieve the dry eye symptoms experienced by millions.

    This I-Corps project will focus on developing a thorough consumer and stake holder comprehension in order to explore the utilization of a novel dry eye treatment device. Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) has only recently been identified as the leading cause of dry eye symptoms and thus current treatment options are limited. The technology developed here utilizes a reusable design in a unique way that promotes natural Meibomian gland expression and improved customer convenience. This solution has potential to gain traction with clinicians through mimicking effective office procedures and supporting known anatomical functions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from its ability to potentially accelerate the process of discovery and manufacture of new vaccines and immunological therapies. These products contain several different components that act together to direct the immune response against a particular pathogen or disease. The technology developed here makes the assembly of these components a rapid and modular process, starting from a platform that naturally alerts the immune system to the presence of a molecular signature of infection. By speeding the construction of vaccine and immunotherapeutic candidates, we will make the overall discovery process faster and more effective, and the production process faster and less expensive. By shortening the time of discovery and manufacture, the pharmaceutical industry as a whole can be more responsive to emerging threats. The technology can also be potentially applied to immunotherapy against cancer and other diseases.

    This I-Corps project combines two core capabilities:  the development of protein nanoparticles derived from viruses as platforms that stimulate the immune system toward molecules attached to them, and highly efficient chemical reactions that make attachments to the protein nanoparticles easy and scalable. Since the molecules that define different infectious agents or disease states can vary widely, such efficient connecting reactions are necessary to make the construction of vaccine candidates routine and modular. Research has defined the methods and linkages needed, and has validated the use of certain protein nanoparticles as effective immune-stimulating agents.  Proofs of concept have been achieved for certain bacterial and parasitic infections, characterized by the display of unique sugar-like molecules on the surfaces of the infectious organisms. The combination of the flexibility of the approach, potentially applicable against a wide variety of diseases, and the ability to rapidly produce promising nanoparticle agents quickly and on large scale, makes the technology attractive for transition from the academic laboratory to potential commercial clinical application.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to potentially enable an innovative wastewater treatment technology to lower costs and improve the sustainability of wastewater treatment. By taking advantage of advances in microbial ecology and natural light fluctuations over the course of the day, the algal-bacterial shortcut nitrogen removal process can provide complete nitrogen removal with very low chemical and energy inputs. The technology will potentially reduce nutrient pollutant discharges to the environment, allowing wastewater facilities to economically comply with existing and future environmental regulations. Application of this technology will help reduce eutrophication (overgrowth of algae) of surface waters and nitrate contamination of groundwater.

    This I-Corps project will focus on customer discovery to investigate how the innovative algal-bacterial shortcut nitrogen removal technology can be potentially integrated into existing wastewater treatment processes. High ammonia strength wastewaters are challenging and costly to treat in conventional biological nitrogen removal systems due to their toxicity and high aeration and chemical requirements. Laboratory research has demonstrated that complete ammonium removal can be achieved in a sequencing batch photoreactor with alternating light and dark periods (day and night). During the light period, oxygen produced through photosynthesis stimulates nitrite production by ammonia oxidizing bacteria. During the dark period, dissolved oxygen is quickly consumed, promoting nitrogen removal from the wastewater. This innovative technology can be applied to the treatment of domestic wastewater sidestreams and agricultural wastewater to reduce the costs, energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions associated with nitrogen removal from wastewaters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in the improved database productivity that the technology can bring to many industries. Existing software systems based on traditional pull-based database engine design and CPU hardware often do not provide the desired high throughput and/or short response time in the management and analysis of large-scale data. The technology developed here offers a more efficient solution to meet such challenges and its commercialization will potentially impact the practice of data management and analysis in a large number of industries including healthcare, retailing, and online advertising. Successful deployment of these the systems developed here will enable a range of industry sectors to efficiently harness big data analytics.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of a data management system with a novel software architecture and advanced data analytics functionalities built on massively parallel hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The technology features a data processing engine under a data streaming (push-based) design and achieves very high utilization of a multitude of computing resources on GPUs. Current experiments show that the data processing throughput and latency are about one order of magnitude better than best known systems built for the same purposes.  The research behind this technology complements current work in database systems and parallel computing fields. The system-oriented approach is in sharp contrast to existing GPU work that typically focuses on solving individual problems and thus highly creative. Innovations are also seen in the formal methods used for meeting system design challenges such as dynamic resource allocation in GPUs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project can widely affect the implementation of photovoltaics, by significantly reducing the cost without compromising on device performance. The low temperature silver reactive inks are projected to use 90 percent less silver than traditional screen-printing technologies. Additionally the low temperature process will use significantly less energy and utilize equipment with relatively low capital expenditures requirements and high throughputs. This technique is of particular importance to temperature sensitive devices and substrates, not only because the reactive inks do not require firing but also because low temperature screen printing silver paste are costly, even more so than their high temperature counterparts. Thus the path envisioned for this technology not only can radically change the cost structure of solar cells but it also has the potential of affecting other markets such as wearable electronics, flexible displays and building integrated devices.

    This I-Corps project further develops findings in the field of evaporation-confined adhesion promotion and reactive ink chemistry. It is based on application of reactive inks to photovoltaics, optimization of adhesion pretreatments, and understanding of printing and drying kinetics of the multiple chemical solutions involved in the process. It has been demonstrated that the process can reduce silver consumption by an order of magnitude and obtain comparable high efficiency to a screen-printed heterojuntion device. It has been further demonstrated that the reactive silver metallization is compatible with the state-of-the-art smart wiring technology for module assembly, reducing the silver consumption even further. It has also been shown that the reactive ink printed modules can withstand damp heat accelerated testing without any signs of performance loses, corrosion or delamination of the modules.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in novel non-contact technology for rheological testing of biological materials, polymeric liquids, and complex fluids. When used in healthcare industry, this acoustic tweezing rheometry technology allows for fast and reliable assessment of blood coagulation using small blood samples collected by a finger prick instead of venipuncture. Additionally, photo-optical tests used in plasma coagulation assays can be integrated in the acoustic tweezing device with viscoelastic tests used in whole blood analysis.  The acoustic tweezing technology can dramatically improve the quality of care for millions of trauma, major surgery and coagulation disorders patients in the United States and worldwide.  When used in petroleum industry, the potential application of the technology is reliable and accurate measurement of rheology and aging of crude oils, which is important for formulating optimal strategies for their extraction and transportation. In chemical and pharmaceutical industries, the technology could be very useful for preparation of polymer materials with required properties and small-scale containerless processing of unique polymer materials that lack impurities generated during polymer contact with solid walls.

    This I-Corps project further develops a non-contact acoustic tweezing technology in which a drop of a fluid sample is levitated in air by acoustic radiation forces and its time-dependent rheological properties are measured from drop shape changes. Key disruptive features of this technology, tested using the laboratory prototype, are the increased reliability and accuracy due to non-contact measurement, the ability to assess temporal changes in rheological properties during processes such as polymerization and coagulation, small sample volume requirement and relatively short procedure time.   The goal of this project is to do focused customer discovery work in the healthcare, petroleum, chemical and pharmaceutical industries to evaluate the commercial potential of the acoustic tweezing technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project in the area of healthcare is significant. The proposed technology can potentially improve the quality of life and life expectancy by allowing the detection of severe medical conditions (such as cancer) at the early stages. The technology can also be extended to diagnose a large variety of medical situations (such as cardiovascular diseases) at the point of care through optimization of the nanophotonic sensor for the detection of a given set of biomarkers. Beyond point-of-care diagnostics, the possibility of detecting multiple blood biomarkers at a low cost enables transformative fields such as predictive health and personalized medicine. The wide range of potential transformative applications and the extensive range of target customers give a compelling commercial potential to the proposed technology.

    This I-Corps project is focused on the development of a transformative medical diagnostic technology for the point-of-care detection of blood biomarkers that play a crucial role in detection of medical conditions such as cancer. The target diagnostic system is a low-cost optical bio-chip that can drastically decrease the assaying cost by eliminating or reducing the need for costly and time-consuming amplifications steps in the existing detection technologies. The use of nanophotonic technology for detection of different medically relevant biomarkers enables the development of ultra-compact highly sensitive, and highly multiplexed sensors that are urgently needed for multiple medical diagnostic scenarios, including cancer. The ability to detect multiple blood biomarkers in a reasonable time with high sensitivity and specificity at a low cost will have a potentially transformative impact on healthcare by bringing diagnostic tools at the point-of-care. Among various nanophotonic solutions, the use of highly miniaturized plasmonic nanostructures has the advantage of higher sensitivity and lower cost. By proper engineering of these nanostructures into an array, higher sensitivity can be achieved.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of new materials and processes for removing natural and anthropogenic contaminants from drinking water.  There are areas that do not have continuous access to clean drinking water from a public utility.  Often water treatment facilities are not able to easily remove organic contaminants from the water source before the disinfection step and distribution.  This technology potentially removes the molecular contaminants that lead to these harmful and regulated disinfection byproducts.  The largest commercial impact related to the technology is likely from removing contaminants from water during acute natural or anthropogenic events.  Drought or floods can increase contaminants into the natural water supply.  Extreme weather can also disrupt water supplies due to flooding, especially when waste water is discharged into the water supply.  Industrial accidents like petroleum spills, pipeline leaks, and coal ash pond breaches can disrupt the water supply of an entire city for weeks or longer.  The materials and processes developed here can be designed for these acute or emergency management events.

    This I-Corps project demonstrates the development of a technology platform to remove molecular and ionic contaminant from natural waters and from treated water.  The technology outperforms current methods at removing the smallest molecules that seem to be the most recalcitrant and can be potentially harmful to human health.  The intellectual merit of this project centers upon this flexible platform of functionalized materials with controllable morphology.  Short oligomers are synthesized with specific functionality to adsorb various water contaminants.  These oligomers are functionalized to scaffolding materials and form a contact resin that adsorbs a high capacity of molecular species in a very rapid rate.  The ability to control the morphology of the scaffolding allows maintenance of the high surface area exposed to the contaminated water.  Moreover, the porosity is kept high enough to allow a fast-filtration method of water treatment.

    This I-Corps project focuses on applying rigorous optimization tools to solve process design optimization problems. For example, the broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project can be associated with giving chemical process designers access to modern optimization techniques. While critical to all chemical companies, optimizing the design of a chemical process (in terms of choosing the process temperatures, pressures, flow rates, etc., that give the best economic performance) is still largely carried out empirically by design engineers. The workflow is typically iterative, labor-intensive and time-consuming, and the optimality of the outcome is not guaranteed. The proposed activity will place at the fingertips of engineers in the chemical, petrochemical, natural gas and other process industries a new computational framework that uses rigorous optimization tools to find the best process design. The commercial potential ranges from increasing the number of process alternatives that can be considered at the design stage, to supporting optimal investment decisions in new production facilities or upgrading existing ones. The proposed activity also has important potential societal impact: investment in US-based chemical production facilities (spurred by recent developments in accessing domestic shale gas and oil resources) will create new jobs and advance the training and development of the current and future workforce engaged in the design and operation of chemical plants.

    Applying rigorous optimization tools to solve process design optimization problems has been hindered by numerical challenges posed by solving the process model - a set of very nonlinear equations corresponding to material and energy balances for reactors, distillation towers, heat exchangers, etc. found in a chemical  and other process plant. The project relies on a recently-invented computational approach for solving and optimizing process flowsheet models. The approach involves a systematic mathematical reformulation of the model equations, resulting in equivalent expressions that can be solved reliably using common numerical methods. A library of unit operation models which can be linked together to create a mathematical model of an entire process is also available, and has been extensively validated on the design optimization of academic and industrial test problems. The commercialization of this work will bridge the large gap that currently exists between industrial practice and the numerous recent advances in optimization theory.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to treat an enormous healthcare danger, infections caused by drug resistance bacteria. The serious threat of drug resistant bacteria, including E. coli, MRSA and K. pneumonia, jeopardizes the health and wellbeing on a global population. Achievement of this development as well as commercializing the product will provide an effective way of delivering therapeutics to multidrug resistant bacteria infections, improving the life quality of patients worldwide. Global healthcare will be greatly improved, benefiting society and saving lives of many patients who currently suffer from drug resistant bacteria.

    This I-Corps project will produce an effective antibacterial drug delivery platform to combat multidrug resistant bacterial infections. Although numerous antimicrobial drugs have been developed with therapeutic efficacy, inefficient delivery is a significant issue due to the antibiotic resistance. An innovative nanomedicine approach is created to encapsulate current antimicrobial drugs in targeted nanoparticles to efficiently delivery drugs and combat the antibiotic resistance. This advanced technology will not only improve healthcare, but also enhance scientific and technological understanding of nanoparticle drug delivery systems in treating antibiotic resistance bacteria infections. This drug delivery system has great potential to advance knowledge as it may be altered to treat many other illnesses if successful.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to alleviate issues related to infant lactation, which impact the health of infants and breast-feeding women, as well as the ability of the latter to contribute at high levels of productivity in activities ranging from work to household chores. In the United States, approximately 85% of mothers with healthy newborn infants express milk within the first four months post-birth, and the majority do so using a breast pump. Yet, the CDC reports that compliance with recommended breastfeeding guidelines is less than 20%. Currently 62% of pump users report problems ranging from insufficient milk extraction to infections. By providing an easier and more comfortable means for pumping neonatal human milk, this project will assist reaching recommended CDC guidelines thereby reducing risks of ear infection, diabetes and intestinal and respiratory viruses in lactating infants and risks of infection in breast-feeding women. By providing means for hands-free milk extraction the technology enables women using breast pumps to remain high levels productivity at home and at work.

    This I-Corps project develops a compression based breast pump that improves efficiency and effectiveness compared to current technologies. Pumps for extracting neonatal human milk currently on the market only operate based on suction, leading to discomfort and lower levels of production. The exclusive use of suction is one of the biggest pitfalls of these pumps. In contrast, the technology being proposed uses compression patterns focused on specific areas of the breast that have been shown to be effective in scientific research. This is achieved by closely mimicking motions recommended by lactation experts. The current prototype can actuate to produce a rhythmic compression on a woman?s breast as she pumps using a typical breast pump. The technology combines advances in the fields of robotics, mechatronics, controls, software engineering, materials and user-centered design with a focus on usability, comfort and ergonomics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a filter to businesses, government agencies, and individuals to eliminate nitrate from water. Nitrate in drinking water has significant impacts on society because it causes serious human health problems. It also promotes the growth of algae in rivers, lakes, and coastal areas, which interferes with tourism, recreation as well as other commercial uses of these areas. The two principal sources of nitrate entering water supplies are the runoff of nitrate fertilizers from agricultural fields and the discharge from municipal and industrial waste-water treatment plants. Intercepting these waters and eliminating the nitrate from them before it enters the environment constitutes a major segment of the potential for commercialization of the technology. Drinking water treatment plants are a potential commercial user, as are homeowners with water purification systems.

    This I-Corps project will explore the potential commercialization of a filter to eliminate nitrate from water. It consists of a bed of sand grains coated with an iron-bearing clay mineral. Before coating, the clay is engineered to react with nitrate. Once coated, the sand/clay mineral attracts and reacts with nitrate in the flowing water, changing it to harmless nitrogen gas or ammonium. Iron in the clay is the key for changing the nitrate. The intellectual merit of the project is that three independent research findings were combined to make the filter. These include processes to reverse the charge on the clay surfaces, changing the iron charge to react with nitrate, and finally engineering a system with suitable flow characteristics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a novel approach towards producing high sensitivity, fast response, ultra-low power consumption, low cost, and highly thermal stable UV sensors. UV sensors have wide ranging markets from industrial, manufacturing, health, to consumer applications, and therefore have significant potential for societal and economic impact. The general public will benefit from the significant reduction in the capital and recurring cost of UV sensor technologies brought by the innovation. The technology has the potential to impact the UV sensor industry by providing lower power consumption, wider operation temperature ranges, and the potential for flexible device embodiments.

    This I-Corps project will enable customer discovery for a core technology that could potentially impact the ultraviolet (UV) sensor industry. Due to large surface-to-volume ratio and reduced dimensionality of the active area, Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanostructures have been shown to have high photon conductance, which leads to high sensitivity of the device performance. Utilizing the Schottky contact instead of conventional Ohmic contact in device fabrication, the sensitivity and response time of ZnO UV nanosensors have been greatly improved. In addition, the device can be deposited on silicon as well as flexible substrates. The characteristics of the ZnO UV nanosensor (i.e. performance metrics, system integration, packaging, form factors, etc.) will be aligned with current and future customer needs, while at the same time, a business model will be explored for this novel technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project seeks to advance concrete construction technology by reinventing cement production with carbonate-based, near CO2-neutral cement and concrete surrogates. It is proposed to utilize flue-gas borne CO2 as an 'ingredient' to rapidly mineralize digitally fabricated construction components. The reinvented cementation chemistry and process enable producing high-quality building elements faster than it is possible today. It also enables the integration of a confluence of technologies, mating carbonate-based cementation solutions with digital fabrication technologies to overcome challenges facing the construction sector today, including its large CO2 footprint, while also potentially improving productivity. By rationalizing workflows, enhancing automation, and originating new materials, this project develops innovative pathways to disruptively transform the construction sector.

    This I-Corps project exploits new advances made the rapid ambient temperature mineralization of carbonate solids. The central technology is based on approaches for sequestering CO2 borne in flue gases in light metal carbonates. This renders carbonate-based cementation agents, which offer performance that is equivalent or superior to traditional cement and concrete. Recent studies have revealed that carbonation hardening process is rapid.   Under suitable conditions  it proceeds to completion in 24 hours or less, substantially faster than existing cementation solutions. Due to their simple composition and chemical homogeneity, the carbonate cement precursors offer flexible, and well-controllable rheology, an important prerequisite for enabling digital fabrication using these materials. Taken together, carbonate-cements offer new routes towards CO2-neutral cementation, and construction.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on new technologies for water treatment. Tap water from a central water treatment facility or a local well is generally of high enough quality to drink without further treatment; however, there are geographic areas where the water is either permanently or temporarily unsafe. Other needs include addressing water aesthetics that are not at unsafe levels but are not desired by the consumer. To enter this market a product needs to be differentiated and cost sensitive. In this project the team we will focus on evaluating the competitive landscape, identifying commercialization partners, and understanding the consumer needs in industrial and household application.

    This I-Corps project uses a new method to cast bio-inspired water treatment membranes. Aquaporin, a highly selective water channel protein, has received worldwide attention because of its potential to form aquaporin-based membranes with high flux and rejection for water treatment. The high water permeability and selectivity of aquaporins makes aquaporin-based biomimetic membranes attractive for water purification.  In this project pores or channels specifically engineered in a pore-spanning biomimetic membrane to maximize water transport efficiency, compared to conventional polymer membrane filters. These bio-inspired membranes display higher contaminant rejection efficiency and significantly improved backflush cleaning effectiveness as compared to traditional membranes. This has the potential to decrease operating costs and increase the life of the membrane.

The use of high levels of pure noble metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium in existing commercial catalysts are increasingly unsustainable in many aspects, including high price, noble metal scarcity, low recycling recovery, and limited global supply, posing significant challenges to catalyst manufacturing. Manufacturing low-cost and efficient catalysts for commercial applications in emission control systems will enable more cost effective adherence to clean air and other environmental regulations. The low-noble metal content catalysts are anticipated to reduce the content of noble metals in the catalysts in comparison with existing catalysts in many emission control systems, reducing the cost of emission control systems.  There is a clear market potential for the catalyst technology in view of the expectation of the global market of emission control system catalysts.

    This I-Corps project focuses on customer discovery in the translation of a new catalyst technology to commercial production of low-noble-metal-content catalysts for emission control systems.  Noble metals such as palladium and platinum are widely used in the catalysts for emission control systems, including factory exhaust gas treatment reactors and catalytic converters, to meet the ever-tightening of emission standards, calling for further reduction of emission levels of the criteria gaseous pollutants.  However, the high costs and market volatility risks associated with the platinum group metals constitute a major area of pain in the market of emission control systems.  To address this challenge, the proposed low-noble-metal-content catalysts feature noble metals alloyed with non-noble transition metals in nano-alloy and composite formulations, which exhibit enhanced catalytic activity and stability for the elimination reactions of the pollutants at significantly reduced use of noble metals in comparison with existing catalysts in the commercial emission control systems.  Insights into the competitiveness of the catalyst technology in the emission control catalyst market will be developed through the intensified activities of customer discovery in this project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on reduction of catheter-related infections and associated healthcare costs. Central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) are extremely dangerous and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. Patients with catheters are significantly more likely to develop an infection than those without a catheter. With an average cost of approximately $45k per patient, CLABSI are the most expensive hospital associated infection to treat. Hospitals spend an estimated $1.38 billion treating inpatient infections due to central lines, and Medicare and insurance companies spend an additional $1.7 billion treating outpatient infections from central line catheters in dialysis patients. More broadly, market opportunities for the technology include: sterilization of urinary tract catheters, prevention of catheter based infections in multi-trauma patients such as military personnel, and wound infection treatment.

    This I-Corps project will evaluate the commercial potential for an antimicrobial wound dressing that exploits the bactericidal effect of blue light to inactivate bacteria commonly colonizing the surface of catheters. The light-emitting catheter dressing is designed to be easily integrated with current standards of care to reduce central line associated blood stream infections. Blue light activates photosensitizers in bacteria, which release reactive oxygen species that are highly cytotoxic by damage of proteins and DNA. Blue light is significantly less harmful to mammalian cells as compared to ultraviolet irradiation, which is commonly used for disinfection of medical facilities, medical devices, water and food. Increasing rates of bacterial resistance indicate the need for infection treatment methods that do not require the use drugs. This device would be marketed to hospitals to reduce cost and patient morbidity and mortality.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable the realization of extremely small, light, high frequency, high inductance, low interference, and cost effective passive electronic devices and components, through the self-rolled-up membrane nanotechnology. The novel form factor for 3D electromagnetic energy storage and confinement could enable breakthrough applications for consumer electronics, smart cities, and the Internet of Things. If successful, this technology can revolutionize the market for high frequency low noise system-on-chip, portable communication devices at 5G and beyond, and wearable electronics, power electronics, wireless sensors for medical imaging and positioning, and wireless body area networks.

    This I-Corps project is based on the self-rolled-up membrane (S-RuM) nanotechnology for extreme miniaturization of passive electronic devices and components.  It provides a novel fabrication pathway for realizing devices in 3D that are extremely small and light, with significantly enhanced functionalities. The overarching principle of S-RuM nanotechnology is strain-driven spontaneous deformation of 2D membranes into 3D architectures. For coil inductors, instead of spiraling the metal wires in plane to increase the inductance, the S-RuM inductors have the metal wires spiraling normal to surface, which naturally minimizes the in-plane footprint. The ultra-small enclosed footprint inevitably enables high frequency operation because of the minimum overlap capacitance with the substrate. Much higher inductance can be achieved because of the strong positive mutual coupling between the turns. In particular, on-chip 3D radio frequency (RF) /microwave/millimeter wave passive devices can be realized that are 1 ? 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those fabricated with conventional CMOS-compatible 2D processes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable superior performance and energy efficiency for cost-sensitive embedded processors.  As computing devices have become ubiquitous and permeated every aspect of life, the need for greater performance has also followed.  However, traditional design techniques to enable high performance microprocessors incur resource costs and typically suffer from poor energy efficiency.  These overheads come at a considerable cost as most embedded designs are energy constrained and highly cost sensitive.  The byproduct of these competing design constraints has been stagnating progress due to the ineffectiveness of traditional techniques. Through the use of this project's novel processor microarchitecture, commercial designs should observe approximately 30% greater energy efficiency and superior performance without incurring resource overhead. Applications such as networking and storage domains are initial candidates for adopting the design.

    This I-Corps project focuses on the creation of an energy-efficient microcontroller through the use of a novel processor microarchitecture.  At the time most fundamental microprocessor techniques were developed, power was not a problem and transistors were scarce.  To satisfy these constraints, designs focused on maximizing utilization of the few execution resources present.  As transistors became more plentiful and performance of greater importance, designs utilized these additional transistors to enable complex organizational and scheduling techniques to maximize the operation of the scarce execution resources.  This project's architecture reverses this trend by allocating additional transistors to execution resources and greatly simplifying organizational and scheduling overheads.  Initial research suggests that considerable energy and area efficiency gains are possible while maintaining a high level of performance in comparison to current commercial designs. Additionally, the novel structure of this microprocessor enables many optimizations that are impractical in conventional designs due to their complex organization and scheduling.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the improvement of drug discovery. Pharmaceutical companies screen millions of compounds before a single agent is selected to undergo human clinical trials. Initial screening of potential therapeutics is conducted in cell culture assays that allow for low-cost evaluation, but are limited in determining therapeutic relevance. This limitation is overcome by additional screening in multiple mammalian models where potential compounds are further assessed for their therapeutic effects, toxicology etc. Yet, the expenses and time associated with mammalian model testing means that only a small percentage of compounds that pass cellculture screening will make it to this stage, effectively overlooking thousands of compounds that may be potent therapeutics. This project?s technology aims at bypassing this bottleneck. It is labor friendly and cost-effective but at the same time will enable companies to test compounds efficacy on an animal model rather than cells in culture thus allowing for further informed decision making in regards to the development of their compounds.

    This I-Corps project offers an innovative method to screen compounds targeting the actin cytoskeleton and its associated genes. C. elegans worms are engineered to replace a cytoskeletal gene, OSG-1, with its human homolog, (ARHGEF10), and worms lacking OSG-1, (OSG-1 KO), are maintained in 96-well plates each containing a different compound. Worms are subjected to a 4-hr heat shock and scored for survival. Because the mortality of OSG-1 KO worms is significantly higher than ARHGEF10, only compounds that target the actin cytoskeleton pathway can differentially change the mortality rates of the KO compared to the ARHGEF10 worm. Compounds that are efficacious but affect the mortality rates of the KO and the ARHGEF10 worm to the same extent do not impinge on the actin cytoskeleton pathway (they represent a second cut because they might act on pathways and mechanisms that are not conserved in humans). Worms are engineered to express GFP through most of the body. Only living worms express GFP whereas dead ones do not. Survival assessment only requires scoring fluorescent worms. With costs only accruing from agar and plate costs, early compounds can be screened for potency at a fraction of the cost of traditional early phase drug discovery methods.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce damage from undetected hot-spots in turbine engines, a common industry problem which impacts costs in repairs, maintenance, and unplanned downtime. Industrial gas turbine production is expected to increase over the coming years and these turbines are expected to operate at much higher temperatures to achieve higher efficiencies, thereby being prone to more incidents that involve overheating. Hotspots go undetected because current thermocouple systems are generally not capable of being placed in pertinent areas and because of bulky cables that restrict placement inside gas turbines.

    This I-Corps project is based on wireless passive sensors that have significant impacts on a new class of sensor technology which is suitable for harsh-environment applications such as turbines, rockets, and fuel cells. This technology can provide reliable long-term sensing to increase the efficiency, improve the operational reliability and reduce the pollution for many systems. A temperature sensor using dielectric resonator structure, a low-profile reflective patch temperature sensor, and a pressure sensor based on evanescent-mode resonator structure, have been demonstrated with operation up to 1300C. These sensors are made of high-temperature-stable and corrosion-resistant Silicoboron Carbonitride (SiBCN) ceramic materials which are suitable for harsh-environment applications. The pressure sensor uses an evanescent-mode resonator structure, in which an air gap dimension decreases when the external pressure increases, causing a decrease in the resonant frequency.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project contributes to the growth of clinical cases that qualify for the use of diagnostic and interventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Currently some patient populations, such as pediatrics, cannot benefit from MRI mostly due to the lack of adequate coils. Flexible and printed coils are lightweight and conform well to the human body, increasing comfort during the exam while increasing reliability, reducing the exam time due to the increased SNR obtained when coils are in close proximity to the sample. In pediatric use, the impact will be two-fold; the coils will increase the accessibility of MRI and decrease the use of general anesthesia resulting in less failed scans. The commercialization of these coils could also increase the number of MR-guided non-invasive therapy. Comfortable and inexpensive coils would assist streamline the process flow in hospitals, thus contributing to a more efficient, more affordable healthcare system.

    This I-Corps project aims to identify the decisive design features required in order to offer the most value to the users of flexible printed coils for MRI. The project will quantify the benefits brought by printed coils through metrics relevant to customers and will lay the foundations of a successful commercialization plan. Receive coils are critical components to achieve high-quality MR images. Commercially available coils use conventional, high-end expensive electronics and are designed as one-size-fits-all with heavy and bulky packaging. Printed coils are lightweight, flexible and can be manufactured at lower cost, while delivering equivalent results and in many cases better image quality than conventional coils. With this technology, coils can be printed to fit all sizes and properly fit the patient anatomy while offering superior comfort.

    The broader/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be primarily in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. This industry desperately needs a tool for extraction of useful information from a large number of densely sampled sensor readings. This need is especially emphasized by the recent dramatic increases both in the number of available sensor readings, as well as the sampling rates at which those readings are collected. This tool is expected to serve a dual purpose in this industry; providing access to information to enable decision making and serve as a data reduction tool which reduces information loss. Furthermore, such a tool is expected to be useful in any industry that employs non-rotating equipment, including the oil and gas extraction, refineries, chemical process industry etc. It is expected that the volume of data gathered in many such industries will continue to increase, further motivating the need to develop and invest in such feature extraction and data reduction tools.

    This I-Corps project will focus on exploring and improving potentials of a technological innovation that will enable a fully automated extraction of informative features from signals generated by non-rotating equipment and processes. Such a tool will be able to reduce the original data into a feature set that is significantly smaller in size than the original signal, thus enabling a significantly easier data management and data mining in a large number of densely sampled sensor signals. The method in the foundation of this tool has recently been developed. It starts by segmenting the signal into a series of steady-state and transient portions, after which each segment of the data is used to construct a number of statistics-based and dynamics based signatures. The ultimate goal is to create a tool that will achieve all this with minimal or, hopefully no human involvement, in contrast to the currently used approaches, which require extensive manual inputs and analyses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to ensure patients with glaucoma are compliant with their prescribed treatment. Compliance with a medication regimen is defined as the extent to which patients take medications as prescribed by their health care providers. Glaucoma patients require lifelong treatment and a strict commitment to administer eye drops daily, which is especially challenging for elderly patients.  The successful application of eye drops requires coordination, manual dexterity, hand-eye coordination, and good vision, which result in fewer than 50 % of patients administering their eye drops as prescribed. Ophthalmic pharmaceuticals (eye drops) represent the most widely used treatment for glaucoma with more than 30 million prescriptions filled in the United States each year. This project has the potential to significantly reduce the number of patients who lose their vision due to glaucoma, dramatically improving the prognosis of those who are afflicted with this disease.

    This I-Corps project is based upon the development of a drug delivery platform to guarantee patients with chronic diseases are and continue to be complaint. Chronic diseases are especially sensitive to compliance issues due to the necessity of the patient to commit to a lifetime of treatment. This will be accomplished through the use of a proprietary drug eluting, thermally-responsive polymer that is liquid at room temperature and solidifies when it heats to body temperature. A solution of the polymer loaded with a therapeutic agent will be inserted into the tear duct where it will solidify, forming a solid, liquid-permeable plug. The plug conforms perfectly to the shape of the patient?s unique anatomy due to the liquid-to-solid phase transition that occurs after insertion. Once inserted, the therapeutic agent is continuously released from the plug, maintaining drug efficacy over an extended period, eliminating the need for the application of daily eye drops and ensuring patient compliance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to shorten the time for new drug development, further ensure the pharmaceutical product quality control, and provide a successful Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tool to the pharmaceutical industry.  There is a trend in the pharmaceutical industry to apply Quality by Design and PAT tools for improving pharmaceutical drug development and manufacturing.  PAT is a system for designing, analyzing and controlling manufacturing using real-time measurements of critical quality and performance attributes of raw and in-process materials and fabrication processes with the goal of ensuring final product quality.  Successful development and application of these PAT tools can enable pharmaceutical firms to speed up the manufacturing process development, and build robustness into manufacturing processes by reducing/eliminating manufacturing errors.

    This I-Corps project proposes to develop a pharmaceutical analyzer system for use in drug development and manufacturing.  The key enabling technology is an x-ray optic to generate an intensive parallel beam.  By using parallel beam geometry, most of the standard sources of error in the measurements are avoided, making the measurement results more reliable.  The large beam size from the optic also improves the measurement statistics in data collection.  A critical innovation for this analyzer is to optimize the whole system configuration to carry out drug phase measurements by setting the detectors at fixed angles (according to the drug) rather than scanning the whole spectrum.  The approach developed here enables the analyzer to continuously measure the phase of drug with very high efficiency.  It would provide the information within minutes during production without complicated sample preparation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a new method of treating Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). This technology utilizes a new type of therapeutic agent, called ?polymer lung surfactants?. RDS is a life-threatening condition that occurs primarily in infants who are born prematurely.  The cause of RDS is the lack of chemical compounds called lung surfactants in the infant?s lungs. Currently, the standard treatment for RDS involves injection of animal-derived lung surfactant compounds into the patient?s lung. However, this animal-derived treatment has major drawbacks: (1) the harvesting process carries the risk of pathogenic contamination; (2) these conventional lung surfactants (containing proteins susceptible to denaturation) require sophisticated delivery procedures that can only be practiced in locations where skilled healthcare professionals and advanced care facilities are available. Due to these factors, RDS remains a serious problem, particularly, in under-developed countries. These significant drawbacks of the current methods offers a potential opportunity for the new polymer lung surfactant technology developed here.

    This I-Corps project will develop a fully synthetic material (polymers) as a cheaper replacement for costly lipid-based formulations for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Lung surfactant plays a critical role in the lung?s ability to process air by lowering alveolar surface tension. For potential lung surfactant applications promising candidate materials have been identified that are capable of replicating the surface-tension-lowering properties of natural lung surfactants. The research will advance understanding of how certain polymers are able to produce extremely low air-water interfacial tensions under dynamic compression (similarly to the natural lung surfactant) and what molecular factors contribute to these behaviors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to transform existing data entry and document archiving systems by introducing an Automatic Data Capture System (ADCS) enhanced by machine learning.  Today many sectors, including the mortgage industry, manufacturing, healthcare, and government agencies, are using cumbersome data entry and document processing techniques. This process not only adds substantially to cost, but also increases inaccuracies in the data pool, cutting into the competitive advantage of industries and agencies. The new system eliminates traditional methods of data extraction and document classification by using a self-learning software program that gathers information from any scanned document in any paper-intensive business processes.  Implementing Robotic Process Automation in data entry business processes in a structured way can accurately extract and process data much faster at a very low cost point.  In addition, the proposed project plan will enhance knowledge about and research on electronic data capture systems used in healthcare, allowing the development of more efficient data-processing techniques that can improve patient care and speed up billing cycles.

    This I-Corps project will implement an effective solution that eliminates time-consuming and error-prone manual data entry. The project will provide valuable insight into the process of scanning, data capture techniques, and machine learning.  The development of technical skills will also be enhanced by an innovative learning framework that explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to data capture and processing.  This proprietary approach to utilizing CNNs in a non-traditional manner has led to exceptional results in identifying and extracting information from scanned documents, making it possible for the first time to fully automate paper-intensive business processes. The commercial success of such a software program is validated by the efforts several companies are making to develop a similar product themselves because currently available technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), cannot offer the level of accuracy required. This new Automated Data Capture System will also enhance research on virtual data systems for representing, querying, and automating data derivation - research that is used in applications such as virtual data language interpreters and data grids.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will consist of creating higher performance human-machine interfaces, with wide-ranging applications not only in robotics, but also in manufacturing, healthcare, and intelligent consumer products. Increasing human-machine collaboration by adding cost-effective and customizable sensory perception, for instance touch sensing, to future machines will have an impact to their safety when operating around people, and will enhance their usability, productivity, and level of personalization. Consumers at large will benefit from product interfaces that are more intuitive and easier to learn and use. Numerous companies and government labs will also benefit from the commercialization of technology resulting from this project, as it will help retrofit their existing infrastructure with robotic skin patches to make it safer and more productive.

    This I-Corps project will undertake commercialization feasibility research for 'Electronic Skin' technologies based on multi-sensory perception of humans interacting physically with machines, through sensing touch pressure, acceleration, temperature and proximity.  Using in-house fabricated tactile sensors embedded in flexible substrates, combined with other types of commercial off-the shelf sensors, this project develops modular systems that can be networked and scaled in large numbers. Numerous sensor components are 3D printed, and can be retrofitted onto existing machinery, such as robots, automated production units, appliances in a cost effective manner. Furthermore, the human-machine interface software of the system involves novel learning algorithms that can adapt to user preferences, decrease the task completion time, and the level of expertise required by users. The adaptive software learns to adjust the human-machine parameters in real-time, according to interaction results, and can take into account sensor degradation over time, user fatigue, and other persistent and costly technical challenges that have limited the widespread adoption of this technology in the past.

The proposed interactive refactoring Technology helps programmers to semi-automate the process of improving the quality of large-scale software projects by detecting, prioritizing and correcting design defects that affect the ease of both understanding and maintenance of the source code of software projects. In large-scale projects, programmers can spend at least 60% of their time in understanding the code. This interactive refactoring technology will significantly reduce that time which leads to higher productivity and much less software bugs. The proposed technology will allow programmers to meet high code quality standards when releasing a new software product and reduce software maintenance activities that can consume up to 90% of the total cost of a typical software project.

    This I-Corps project is to semi-automate the process of improving software quality by recommending refactoring changes, using computational search techniques, instead of the current manual refactoring tools support. Manual refactoring is error-prone, time consuming and not useful for radical refactoring that requires extensive application of changes to correct unhealthy code. This technology formalizes software refactoring as a dynamic interactive optimization framework that provides refactoring-centric interaction, enables refactoring and development to proceed in parallel and collects interactive information in a non-intrusive manner that can be used to inform dynamically the refactoring process. This technology recommends ways to make code quality easy to estimate, improve, evolve and reason about. The proposed refactoring technology has been successfully used by active programmers in both open source and industrial projects. Based on the high performance and low cost of the interactive refactoring technology, it may replace the current refactoring tools in the marketplace.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a significant increase in the efficiency of hospital procedure scheduling.  The project analyzes the sources of inefficiencies in the planning, staffing, coordination, and execution of the various phases of surgeries and associated procedures.  Preliminary analysis of hospital data shows that the throughput of surgical units can be increased significantly with the same staffing while reducing the delays and improving the working conditions of the personnel. Delays in obtaining and communicating updates on the status of surgeries and on actions that personnel should perform are major causes of inefficiency, as is the randomness of the duration of tasks. We expect the methodology to be widely applicable to the coordination of teams in services and transportation industries.

    This I-Corps project is based on a machine learning approach to the optimization of real-time messaging tuned using actual hospital data. The technical novelty is a formulation of the real-time policies that incorporates the messages between the main actors and enables the use of machine learning to optimize the policies.  The approach combines new parametric models of real-time scheduling, stochastic gradient descent, and infinitesimal perturbation analysis. In this formulation, perturbation analysis computes the gradient of the objective function with respect to the timing of messages and results in an efficient algorithm.  The algorithm discovers the best time to send messages to optimize a combination of operating room efficiency and patient waiting times.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop safe and effective therapies for patients suffering from obesity and its associated risks of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Obesity is a complex disorder that is characterized by greater energy intake than consumption, resulting in excessive lipid storage in the white adipose tissue. The proposed innovation offers a polymer-based nanoparticulate technology platform that enables targeted 'burning' of 'bad fat'. Successful completion of the proposed activities will enable promising market opportunities, understanding the most critical needs of customers and strategic partners, and determining the potential for commercialization. This controlled release technology platform can also be readily adapted to treat a broad spectrum of diseases such as fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis.

    This I-Corps project is built upon a novel biodegradable polymer-based nanoparticulate drug delivery system that targets white adipocytes and enables sustained intracellular release of Notch inhibitors to induce transformation of white adipocytes into beige adipocytes to raise energy expenditure and reduce adiposity. The technology combines advances in polymer-based drug delivery with an understanding of the role played by Notch signaling in adipocyte plasticity for the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies to reduce adiposity. Obesity is triggered by the systemic energy surplus that is stored as lipids in white adipocytes, whose expansion leads to obesity. The newly-identified beige adipocytes in white adipose tissue are capable of actively metabolizing lipids to generate heat. This technology offers several potential advantages over conventional drug delivery including continuous and lower dosage drug release, reduced cost, decreased off-target side effects, increased patient compliance, and avoidance of expensive surgical procedures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to bridge the gap between genomics and medicine by bringing a technology used in research laboratories to the forefront of diagnostics at an affordable cost. There is a vital need for a more accurate and faster diagnosis of dangerous and infectious microbes such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. Treatment for infections and viruses are two of the top ten reasons people visit hospitals, and infectious diseases are a leading cause of death in children worldwide. Additionally, the numbers of these illnesses continue to grow as bacteria and other microbes become more resistant to current medications. Fortunately, the next-generation sequencing revolution has provided a flood of genomic sequence data from a variety of organisms, including pathogens. This data has remained untapped in the medical field, which can benefit from the ability to quickly and accurately identify genetic markers of dangerous pathogens. The potential market for this project extends beyond research hospitals and includes smaller clinics in remote locations, or military field hospitals situated near global conflicts.

    This I-Corps project optimizes the well-established qPCR (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) technology to amplify pathogen specific DNA sequences. The technology leverages publically available genomic resources to design unique and specialized primers to be supplied in a simple kit for PCR that will identify specific classes of pathogens. The equipment for quantitative DNA amplification is standard, and the resultant amplification results are visualized in-hospital also on standard equipment. The kits could enable medical specialists and other healthcare providers to give patients more accurate and rapid diagnoses at a fraction of the cost while accelerating treatment, reducing the number of repeat visits, decreasing antibiotic usage, and shortening hospital stays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is centered around the ability to potentially reinvent interactions with indoor spaces.  Similar to how GPS has revolutionized how we explore the world outdoors, indoor positioning can augment indoor experience with new information; having impact through the whole chain from end users to the surrounding industries.  For example, the ability to track critical equipment indoors can save lives as in the hospital ER, understanding the flow of people inside of buildings can optimize our approach to energy management, and the availability of precise navigation indoors can be used by both humans and robots to streamline factory and warehouse operations.  Commercially, the opportunity for this technology is significant.  The general indoor positioning market is estimate to grow 42% annually to $10 billion by 2018.  Today's indoor positioning solutions remain imprecise and/or too cumbersome to deploy - diluting their commercial and societal impact to date.  This technology fills a crucial gap in this space by providing indoor positioning that is at the same time accurate, compatible with today's devices, and easy to deploy.

    This I-Corps project concerns an indoor positioning platform that is accurate, compatible with any Wi-Fi enabled user device (smartphones, tablets), and easily deployable.  Research in this area has led to the development of hardware and algorithms that allow for sub-meter position accuracy indoors via easily manufactured compact Wi-Fi nodes built from commodity hardware. Simply placing these nodes at known locations in any indoor space allows for immediate positioning of user devices without additional pre-deployment effort.  While GPS has revolutionized outdoor positioning, it does not work indoors. Current non-GPS solutions to this problem compromise accuracy, or require expensive hardware or calibration in the environment. This solution is both easy to deploy and accurate, filling an important gap in the indoor positioning industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on the economic and safety benefits that arise from the improved inspection and maintenance of infrastructure assets. Assets in this context can refer to transportation systems such as bridges and roadways, energy sector systems such as offshore oil platforms and pipelines, or telecommunications towers, all of which must be routinely inspected for safety and functionality. The 'asset intelligence' platform will potentially benefit not only asset owner/operators, but infrastructure stakeholders and the general public by providing a more comprehensive record and understanding of infrastructure performance, improving strategic planning and maintenance processes, and optimizing total impact and cost of ownership. Beyond the economic benefits that improved decision-support software will provide to customers, improvements to inspection processes will also benefit the safety of the general public.

    This I-Corps project will explore new solutions to the challenges of infrastructure inspection and management.  During an inspection, a range of information is collected about an asset, including inspector observations, images, sensor readings, and nondestructive testing results.  Challenges persist in the efficient and effective exploitation of this data, limiting its value and frequently resulting in overly conservative and economically sub-optimal decisions about an asset. This projects envisions a new process for integrating and visualizing inspection information by creating a 'digital twin' of an asset.  Using a novel 3D modeling process, a virtual reality model of an asset can be generated. A broad range of inspection and environmental data is then overlaid on this model, serving as the data-of-record over the lifetime of the asset, and providing data continuity in support of real-time, synoptic, and forensic analyses.  These digital twins can be accessed through conventional computers and subsequently through virtual and augmented reality platforms to improve field inspection processes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project on the use of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software for turbulent flows may be transformational.  Turbulent flows occur ubiquitously; and, CFD methods are routinely used to assess flow assurance and safety issues associated with industrial scale flows. Although computer hardware and software technologies have advanced significantly, current closure models for the turbulent stress seriously limit the commercial value of CFD methods. Recent research related to the turbulent stress closure problem provides an opportunity to improve the performance of CFD software used to design next generation chemical and nuclear reactors, aircraft engines, automotive engines, and wind turbines for power generation. The proposed innovation will also support prototype designs of hydrocyclone separators as well as prototype designs for next generation industrial mixers.

    This I-Corps project offers a software solution to a longstanding problem related to turbulence. Although the turbulent stress closure problem has been a core issue of research for more than a century, a fully-realizable closure model is not presently supported by any commercial software package. This project will address this need by providing complementary software that implements a new class of fully-realizable algebraic stress models consistent with the low-order statistical properties observed in rotating and non-rotating turbulent flows. Most significantly, the closure models are fully-realizable regardless of the benchmark flows selected to calibrate model parameters. This discovery will have a significant impact on the current use of computational fluid dynamic software for turbulent flows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the translation of innovative platforms for renewable and environmentally-sound production practices for isoprenoid (specifically, triterpenoid) compounds from laboratory/demonstration scale to the marketplace. The target triterpenoids have many potential uses: in vaccines as immunogenic adjuvants, human or animal nutritional supplements, cooking oil stabilizers, high revolution machine lubricants, and as replacements for specialty chemicals currently only available from petrochemical feedstocks. These production platforms include plant-based as well as microbial fermentation supply chains to meet diverse client/customer needs. These new production methods are designed to meet a growing market need for non-animal produced, high-quality squalene and squalene-like compounds.

    This I-Corps project relies upon unique Synthetic Biology approaches to engineer the biosynthesis and accumulation of novel chemicals in plants and fermentable fungi. These genetic engineering strategies utilize yeast lines which have specific genome edits to allow the accumulation of high amounts of triterpenes. Similarly, genetically modified plant lines have been developed which accumulate high amounts of these compounds in seeds and other easily harvested and stored tissues. Together, these platforms provide an environmentally sound alternative to the current, unsustainable practices of isolating these compounds from shark livers or slow-growing algae cultures. While most genetically modified plants provide value-added traits (such as insect protection or herbicide resistance), this approach here is to specifically produce high-value chemicals that have been previously limited to natural sources or produced in costly fermentation facilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to efficiently match, using intelligent  multi-agent software, original equipment designers to manufacturers who have the necessary capabilities to fulfill those needed services. On one side, the solution directly empowers small and medium scale manufacturers to advertise unused machine capacity that can be rented out to clients who require small lot production of components.  The platform may also provide them the ability to focus their business development efforts to obtaining short term and long term contracts through the broker system. On the other end of the solution, the platform directly impacts system integrators by providing them with a near real-time state of suppliers' performance and technical metrics. The solution architecture also allows enterprise customers to update their supplier databases in near real-time states without manual recurrent processing of supply chain information.  The solution intends to make supplier sourcing, vetting and selection to be more efficient. Ultimately, the system intends to cut the time between product conception to production and delivery.

    This I-Corps project is based on the functions and operations of a manufacturing service selection platform. Real-time streaming data from machines on a factory floor populates a virtual digital twin representation of the physical machine and its corresponding factory model in cyberspace. Utilizing a multi-agent simulation software algorithm, we match design and manufacturing features of a given product to manufacturers who have the capacity and capabilities to meet those requirements. The results of the simulation provide an intelligent decision making tool for original equipment designers to source suppliers who are best suited to meet both business and technical requirements. This digital connectivity of machine assets across job/contract shop factories provides unprecedented visibility into machine capabilities and capacities within the supply chain for real-time decision making in supplier sourcing and selection.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is promoting efficient, reliable and secure operation of electricity infrastructure.  Improving efficiency in planning and dispatch of electric power leads to significant improvements in economically efficient dissemination of energy resources which also prevents unnecessary polluting emissions and energy waste. In addition, it prevents failures in real-time balancing of electricity demand and supply. The software may facilitate large-scale wind power integration by better prevention of transmission congestion and more considerate network and wind farm expansion plans. Developing a fast and accurate electric power dispatch software solution has been an unmet demand for the electric utilities, Independent System Operators and power grid planners and consultants for the past decades. This project is aimed at a software tool for analyzing the electric grid market operations that can efficiently improve the customer's commonly-used solutions.

    This I-Corps project intends to provide an innovative power system analysis solution which significantly improves the existing approximate methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The commonly-used power flow analysis methods represent a clear weakness in power system operations. Although AC power flow offers the highest accuracy, it does not meet the computational speed requirements, and in the case of large networks, using this method is not practical. On the other hand, DC power flow offers a high computational speed by a rough linear approximation of the full AC power flow, where unreliable assumptions are made regarding the voltage profile and angles, conductor losses, and reactive power balance. These assumptions lead to significant errors and deviations from AC power flow results, especially under heavy load conditions or in highly resistive networks. Nevertheless, power system operators still resort to using DC and AC power flow methods in the respective applications. Improving solution techniques for the power flow model in the context of optimal power flow could potentially lead to significant energy cost savings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide home owners with reliable, real-time appliance energy information and guidance to manage their electricity consumption more efficiently and to facilitate the transition to distributed renewable energy generation and local microgrids through a low cost electricity data acquisition and analytic device. A smart energy system relies on balancing various internal power demands in order to maximize efficiency and minimize cost to users. This technology offers a low-cost, easily-installed device that can be used in residential settings, allowing consumers to identify which appliances are operating at a particular time and the real-time cost of electricity consumption. It can provide real-time data to the residential customers in order to facilitate broader energy management of distributed installations.

    This I-Corps project is based on a smart energy analytic disaggregation system is built with open-source, embedded system composed of low-cost, off-the-shelf components, combining hardware and software. The system uses mathematical transformations to compress the data and machine-learning classification algorithms on the embedded processor to decompose building electric circuit load signals. Data are linked to appliance specific components by capturing and analyzing current and voltage data at a high sampling rate, differentiating among individual appliance signals, their harmonics, and unique signatures. The device has capacity for multiple sensors and can be updated continuously or daily via the existing internet infrastructure. The more devices and the longer it measures and analyzes, the better the algorithm becomes at appliance energy use identification.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be in the modernization of the electrical power grid and solving the challenges of integrating large scale renewable sources to the grid while improving the reliability, resilience, affordability, and flexibility of the electric power grid. This project's hardware/software controller turns the battery energy storage system from a passive component in the grid to an active and smart component which is able to benefit both grid operators and customers automatically. This technology will benefit utilities and independent system operators through providing enhanced grid services and reducing investment cost of system expansion. The commercial potential of this technology is due to its capabilities for improving power quality, increasing power system reliability, decreasing green gas emission, reducing peak demand, and maximizing renewable energy utilization. This technology will also benefit commercial, residential, and industrial customers by potentially reducing their electricity bill, increasing power reliability, and providing them with revenue in the energy market. The end product is a software/hardware controller panel which will be integrated with a battery energy storage system consisting of battery modules, inverter and measurement devices.

    This I-Corps project involves a real time hardware/software controller for smart operation of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in the grid. The developed technology incorporates a novel control algorithm/structure in the form of an integrated hardware/software device, to control the power flow of BESS. The control hardware is configured for effective interaction of the controller with inverter, battery management system, and measurement units. The control software is structured to manage the communication, safe operation and monitoring of the system. This product, by employing control, machine learning, discrete signal processing, and optimization methods, enables BESS as a buffer to dynamically compensate for the renewable intermittency and load uncertainty in the power grid. The main advantage of the controller is to minimize the size of allocated battery for applications such as voltage regulation, renewable compensation, and load compensation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve dietary compliance and health outcomes in diabetic and pre-diabetic populations. Almost 30 million Americans adults have Type II diabetes. Type II diabetes is a serious public health concern, as its complications, which include cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness and amputations, greatly affect patients' health and quality of life. To effectively self-manage their disease, patients face the difficult task of controlling their glucose levels by following dietary guidance and preventing excessive weight gain. Digital health products have the potential to improve patient adherence to these recommendations by providing real-time, interactive self-management aid. Yet, existing mobile diabetes self-management applications are limited to their function as glucose trackers. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a proactive diet-related decision-making support system that is personalized to continuously monitored glucose concentrations. The integration of software and sensor technology will result in a more efficient and individualized method to prevent disease progression in Type II diabetics.

    This I-Corps project examines the commercial feasibility of using biological inputs from wearable sensors to eliminate the need for calorie-tracking and develop personalized and dynamic real-time food-related decision support. Our proprietary algorithms use continuous glucose readings as biological feedback to assist diabetic patients with decisions about what and when to eat. Previous studies have demonstrated improved glycemic control and sustained weight loss using portable glucometers to improve self-regulated eating behavior in overweight non-diabetic populations. The proposed technology will translate this evidence-based biobehavioral intervention approach to Type 2 and pre-diabetic patients in real-time. The user interface will be a mobile platform with graphical outputs to assist with 'in-the-moment' decision-making as well as to monitor their glucose variability. The platform will provide summary statistics for patients that can be shared with their healthcare providers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to discover the commercial opportunity for high temperature thermoelectric materials and devices. A total of ~2600 trillion BTU/year of wasted heat energy are generated during US industrial processes, which can be directly converted into 16GWh of electricity using the outlined high temperature thermoelectric device. The value of this generated energy is estimated to be $14 billion/year using current electricity pricing, $0.10/KWh. During the course of this program the team will investigate the potential market to determine customer?s needs and the key requirements for a viable solution. Our customer discovery will begin with the target industry power generation. If this market offers limited potential, we will explore other potential markets, such as portable electronics and chemical processing, to explore their needs and requirements.

    This I-Corps project uses structured hypothesis-validation approach to develop commercial translation plan of high temperature thermoelectric materials and devices. This will include determining: value proposition; customer/user-case; demand creation; channel development; revenue model; partnership strategy; and resource development. The fundamental knowledge to be used includes: 1) tuning the thermoelectric properties of nitrides and oxides through controlling nanostructure length-scale and 2) developing cost-effective materials processing technology for nanostructure thermoelectric materials. As a result, a market specific prototype of a non-toxic and cost effective thermoelectric device may be developed to enable large-scale waste heat harvesting in the high temperature regime.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves enabling increased utilization of renewable energy power sources such as solar and wind. Due to the intermittency of these power sources, energy storage systems must be connected to our electrical grid in increased amounts to help stabilize the grid through storage of energy during peak production times and release of energy during peak consumption. The technology developed consists of stable carbon-based materials that can store charge for extended periods of time. These materials may allow for the production of batteries with organic electrolytes, specifically called redox flow batteries, which can be charged at higher power densities and have higher energy capacities than current aqueous-based counterparts. In addition to stationary energy storage, these materials could serve as additives in lithium-ion batteries that can extend lifetimes and prevent catastrophic failure through protection during abusive conditions that result from charging batteries to too-high potentials. Yet another possibility is to use these materials to initiate chemical reactions that allow for lower-cost preparation of polymer coatings through the elimination of metal complexes.

    This I-Corps project involves the exploration of potential markets for stable, electron-donating phenothiazine derivatives as potential materials for energy-storage applications and polymerization initiators. These materials were developed as a result of studying a variety of fused-ring heterocyclic organic compounds with varying substituent identity and position, which led to identification of characteristics that led to greater stability in multiple states of oxidation (neutral, radical cation, and dication). The most stable derivatives were tested as redox shuttle additives that limit voltage in overcharging lithium-ion batteries and were found to have extensive performance in batteries containing commercially utilized electrode materials due to their high stability.  High solubility led to their incorporation into battery electrolytes at high concentrations, which allowed for high-rate overcharge protection. More recently, the study of these materials as catholytes for non-aqueous redox flow batteries showed extensive lifetimes in symmetric cells at high concentrations and with high charging currents. In fact, in many cases, high stability has allowed for their isolation as crystalline radical-cation salts. Furthermore, these materials have been shown to initiate cationic polymerizations using visible light, which may lead to their use as photo-redox catalysts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the commercialization of a potentially game-changing filtration technology based on the synergistic electrochemical reactions created on membrane surfaces. Membrane filtration is indispensable for a wide spectrum of industrial applications such as drinking water treatment, food processing, chemical purification, and pharmaceutical engineering. This project will provide filtration users the value propositions in saving capital costs on membrane cleaning, maintenance, replacement as well as high quality products (e.g., filtered water). This project will also impact membrane manufacturers by increasing the demand for multifunctional and reactive membranes in the global market of membrane filtration, which is estimated to reach $2.64 billion by 2018. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this project is to upgrade and transform current membrane industries from traditional physical filtration into advanced and chemically reactive membrane systems. This process will also potentially lead to new business opportunities and foster workforce development.

    This I-Corps project addresses a long lasting goal of developing more efficient, flexible, durable, and multifunctional membrane technologies. This project investigates a novel reactive electrochemical membrane (REM) powered by electric polarization. During REM filtration, electric current runs through the membrane to generate highly reactive radicals (a chemical that rapidly react with organic compounds and oxidizes them into carbon dioxide and water). Thus, the membrane fouling due to organic matter accumulation or pore clogging can be effectively mitigated. This invention will demonstrate multiple benefits through the applications in algal biomass separation processes. Specifically, the project will fabricate and test a suite of REMs to evaluate biomass separation efficiency, permeate water quality, and anti-fouling properties and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of electrochemical oxidation and impacts on fouling mitigation. The results will provide fundamental guidelines as to the rational design of new-generation reactive membranes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to help millions of individuals with chronic or acute disabilities leading to loss of communication and computer control abilities. The proposed assistive context aware interface (ACAI) will allow these individuals to regain the ability communicate with caregivers and families, and to control their environments, which will lead to increase in quality of life and in some cases improvement in received healthcare. Potential customers include close to 4 million people worldwide, with conditions such as spinal cord injuries, strokes, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. This project will pursue the commercialization of ACAI as a stand-alone computer interface with which individuals can use existing assistive technology, including augmentative and alternative communication solutions that targets individuals as customers, and its commercialization as part of a complete intensive care unit delirium assessment system that will be offered to hospitals for improved patient care.

    This I-Corps project will offer an infrastructure that supports rich contextual information exchange between physiological and behavioral sensors that capture human intent for the control of computer applications. The assistive context aware interface (ACAI) framework is based on Bayesian inference and information theoretic coding principles that ensure mathematical rigor in design in offering almost optimal speed-accuracy performance to the user. The framework is based on the human-in-the-loop cyber-physical systems design principles, which ensures a user-centric, modular and scalable design for assistive computer access using all physiological and behavioral signals that can be exploited by the users in their clinical conditions. ACAI unifies body and brain physiological signal processing in human intent inference. Convenient user customization will allow users to exploit multiple input modalities to control assistive computer applications, and promises an adaptive solution that can cater to their changing needs during treatment or disease progression.

    The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project lies in the diversion of fats, oils and grease (FOG) from landfill disposal to be reused as fuel in a low cost and environmentally friendly approach.  The use of the technology will also potentially reduce sewer pipe blockage.  Presently, approximately 4 billion pounds of trap grease and 2.7 billion pounds of used cooking oil are produced each year which can potentially yield nearly 500 million gallons of fuel. This is a significant addition to the total current biodiesel production of roughly 1,200 million gallons per year. This technology will greatly reduce waste disposal costs for commercial food processors, restaurants and fat rendering facilities. It can also offer biodiesel producers a low cost feedstock.

    This I-corps project will explore the commercial potential of a solvent-free extraction approach which can overcome the challenges of fats, oils and grease (FOG) emulsion, namely the impurities and high moisture content of the sewer grease.   The approach does not use chemicals or solvents new to the current biodiesel process. Separate moisture removal processes are needed unlike other competing technologies.  As a result of these two advantages, this process is expected to have lower energy consumption and lower costs than existing processes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project primarily involves the development of a more robust nuclear/radiation security and safety infrastructure that enables government and law enforcement agencies to lower the risk of nuclear terrorism or radiation exposure. A successful implementation of the project will provide better screening and detection tools embedded into a real-time radiation-monitoring safety and security network. This will improve the protection and monitoring capabilities that range from building-scale stand-alone sensor networks (impacting nuclear power plants and hospitals) all the way to city-scale sensor grids for border protection and Smart City integrations. Commercial potentials are also expected in several other directions such as mass spectrometry, power-grid monitoring, automotive engine tuning and emissions testing, and small payload space applications.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial viability of a low-cost, high-sensitivity, scalable, networkable and disruptive new ion sensing technology for nuclear security and radiation safety applications. The technology exploits certain novel physical properties of advanced nanomaterials which renders them with unprecedented sensitivity down to single-ion detection. The sensors are able to operate over a wide range of doses, perform equally well in air or under vacuum, and can clearly distinguish between positively and negatively charged ions, which are critical for most radiation-detection applications. Considering size, weight, power-consumption, performance and cost parameters, this technology is well-poised to be an extremely attractive alternative to many current ionizing radiation detection approaches.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps team project includes possible commercialization of new, selective catalysts that provide safer and more efficient production of chemicals and chemical products from petrochemical and renewable feedstocks at lower cost, with less chemical waste, and with lower energy requirements.  Catalysts are substances that dramatically increase reaction rates for desired products.  In many cases, commercial production of a chemical product is not possible without the use of a catalyst.  Approximately 90% of all chemical production requires the use of a catalyst in at least one step of the production process. This includes the production of bulk chemicals, plastics and polymers, synthetic rubber, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, fuels, and chemicals used in consumer products and in the food industry. The need for new catalysts that are more selective and provide more efficient chemical production at lower cost spans all sectors of the chemical industry.

    This I-Corps project focuses on a unique family of patented constrained geometry ligands and metal catalysts that have potential applications in several of the market segments of the chemical industry. Development of this technology for specific applications is in the preliminary stages, but basic proof-of-concept of proprietary constrained geometry catalyst production has been demonstrated and patent coverage has been obtained. Based on initial customer interviews, the team will focus on evaluating customer needs in the polymer, rubber, and petroleum refining segments of the chemical industry. Specifically, the team will explore customer needs for more selective, more active, and less expensive catalysts for conversion of petrochemical and renewable feedstocks to polymers and other value-added products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to have advanced lithium-sulfur batteries enable increased range of electric vehicles with lower cost.  One of the most challenging problems in electric vehicles is the short driving distance and relatively high cost, which have been mainly caused by the performance of the current Li-ion batteries. These batteries are good for small electronics such as cell phones and computers, but their energy densities and prices do not meet the current demand required for large scale systems. The proposed battery technology can achieve an energy density five times higher than those of the current Li-ion batteries as well as lower the manufacturing cost.

    This I-Corps project will further develop a process technology that enables sponge-like three-dimensional carbon nanotube bulk materials while maintaining the properties of individual nanomaterials.  With this novel scalable synthesis method, the junctions/contacts between carbon nanotubes are seamlessly connected by covalent bonding, ensuring excellent electron transport across the junctions/contacts. Typical methods for commercial carbon nanotubes result in powdery materials which necessitates additional manufacturing processes to make practical bulk materials.  In comparison to the conventional methods for making battery electrodes, the novel manufacturing method used in this project results in electrically conducting scaffold electrodes with large surface areas, eliminating inactive binders and conductive additives in batteries, which allows for remarkably increasing the energy density of lithium-sulfur batteries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the implementation of a disruptive technology that can transform the landscape of energy storage. This project aims to combine millions of copper wire used to transport electricity with energy storage technologies that are typically expensive, large, or heavy. This approach has many value generating applications in the aerospace, automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. In the event of a power shortage in a data center or server room, websites or cloud services are at risk of going offline. By combining energy storage with copper wires, this project would ensure that these services stay online during a shortage and will maximize space in server rooms by removing backup batteries enabling the companies to offer more services. This same technology could cut the weight soldiers carry during military operations, reduce the cost of energy, improve the output of electric vehicles or wind turbines.

    This I-Corps project will further develop a cable-based-supercapacitor (CSC) technology. The CSC will simultaneously store and transport electricity. This is accomplished by a novel method of growing high aspect ratio nano-whiskers on the surface of copper cable/fibers which greatly increases the surface area. This increase in surface area provides highly enhanced energy storage capability to the CSC. A proof-of-concept device has demonstrated the CSC's function and durability in potential commercial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create additives that can replace hazardous and toxic corrosion inhibitors with more environmentally friendly alternatives. Direct costs of corrosion are enormous both financially and also by impacting health and safety.  Examples of such health and safety impacts are due to the breakdown of the structural integrity of buildings, the deterioration of infrastructure and the leaching of heavy metals into water supplies. While the demand for corrosion inhibitors is growing, some common and effective solutions are being phased out due to their hazardous effect on environmental and human health. The corrosion inhibitor replacements developed in this project will potentially reduce the amount of harmful corrosion protection materials currently used to protect a large variety of metal-based structures, such as buildings, bridges, pipelines, ships, cars, trucks, and airplanes.

    This I-Corps project aims to advance a novel encapsulation system for controlled release of inhibitors that provides smart corrosion protection to metal coatings. The encapsulation enables the use of environmentally friendly inhibitor alternatives that are currently incompatible with coatings. It achieves this by preventing contact between the inhibitor and the coating during coating application and providing controlled release during corrosion-triggered events, allowing on-demand corrosion protection. Consequently, the environmental impact of corrosion protection systems can be decreased through the use of more environmentally friendly materials and the reduction of the required amount of inhibitive compounds. Further, they can be incorporated into existing corrosion protection systems without significant changes in coating formulation or application method.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve gas sensing for chemical and environmental monitoring, food safety, and antiterrorism capabilities. The global gas sensor market is estimated to be about $20 billion, while the subset of the nanosensor segment is only $13.1 million in 2014. The small market size is partially attributed to the lack of feasible manufacturing techniques that allow the utilization of novel nanomaterials for sensor applications. The complexity and the cost have prevented rapid growth of domestic nanosensor market despite tremendous progress in nanomaterials research and development. This technology may reduce the cost and complexity of manufacturing of nanowire sensors and could potentially propel significant growth of the nanosensor market.

    This I-Corps project pursues a gas sensor manufacturing technology, which is compatible with current microelectronics. It relies on a solution crystallization process that places nanowires directly and precisely on chips. The technology stems from a discovery when organic crystalline compounds were mixed with nanoparticles, nanowires nucleated on nanoparticles upon solvent evaporation. The nanowire sensor has been tested against a number of gases to obtain sensor performance data. In current competing technologies, nanowires need to be aligned and placed at precise locations and orientations on the patterned substrates, a complex process to scale up. This method synthesizes organic nanowires directly on the metal substrates by using the substrate pattern as nucleation points for the nanowire growth and orientation.

Through home health monitoring, the proposed sensing product can be potentially improve health outcomes of recently discharged cardiac patients. This will also reduce chances of heart failure after release, which is one of the leading causes for hospital readmission. While application can provide significant benefits to the health community, the proposed product can be used for other services as well. The device can also serve as an unobtrusive means to collect information for personal health, athletic training, etc. The device can also be potentially useful in human-machine systems studies.

    This I-Corps project is based on a flexible, thin film heart rate sensing array. The device uses quantum dots, which have proven to be an effective functional element for optical microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices.

The materials chosen allows the MEMS device to be a thin, flexible film, which will allow it to be easily installed on flat, contoured surfaces such as a phone, computer mouse, or clothing. This contribution to sensing technology will allow Blood Volume Pulse to be measured when users come into physical contact with these items.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps is in utilization of a byproduct of water treatment for reducing harmful impact of agricultural runoff.  Spent lime is a common byproduct generated during the treatment process in water treatment plants. This project will beneficially reuse spent lime to reduce disposal costs for municipalities, improve water quality, and provide a suitable product to enhance agricultural production. Agricultural runoff and drainage of phosphorus are considered to be a contributing factor to eutrophication and proliferation of harmful algal blooms.  The technology developed here utilizes spent lime from water treatment plants to remove phosphorus from surface waters.  The spent material removed from the system will serve as a nutrient-enhanced product with many potential uses, including application directly to agricultural land or incorporation as a fertilizer additive.

    This I-Corps project utilizes spent lime as a sorbing material to remove phosphorus from surface waters.  Calcium ions in spent lime form covalent bonds with orthophosphates to form calcium phosphate.   Thus, phosphorus in a dissolved form precipitates to a solid form.  The technology used here has demonstrated adsorption of phosphorus to spent lime is nearly instantaneous with a considerable calculated sorption capacity.   Maximum phosphorus removal can be achieved by increasing the mass of spent lime.  This project develops a phosphorus interceptor system that utilize spent lime as filter material.  To maintain optimal performance, spent lime is replaced with new material after reaching phosphorus saturation.  The resulting material is nutrient-enhanced with multiple potential agricultural uses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves a reliable on-line assessment pedagogical tool that provides an alternative to traditional course evaluations. Traditional instruction evaluation tools have been found to have skewed results depending on the gender or ethnicity of the instructor, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. The project has the potential to add to the repertoire of commercially-viable assessment tools that offer ease of use, seamless data analysis features, and storage of pedagogical data. This tool will be marketed initially to higher education, particularly teaching institutions (e.g., community colleges and specialty engineering schools), university teaching and learning centers, or areas where teaching is emphasized. Natural extensions to this market include K-12 schools; extension and for-fee educational programs; high-end online professional programs; hospitals where teaching and training are primary emphasis; and corporate training programs. Typically, professionals in these environments are expected to operate at high levels of proficiency and often are expected to confirm this proficiency among clients, investors, and broader society.

    This I-Corps project builds on the Global Real-time Assessment Tool for Teaching Enhancement (G-RATE), an all-inclusive, online assessment tool that collects course data and analyzes this data in the form of pedagogical profiles in an easy-to-use platform. G-RATE consists of five components that collect course data real-time via direct observations, obtain instructor reflections of teaching and students' survey responses, and compiles data and profiles for researchers and administrators. Elements of the G-RATE have been validated from data across over a large number of courses with positive impacts on student learning in observed STEM classrooms.

    The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project affects the significant energy consumption that is due to separation processes.  From petroleum refinery to food and beverage production, many industrial processes need to overcome the entropy of mixing.  Membrane separation is the most energy efficient method of separation, but commercial membranes are inherently limited by their material properties.  In particular, high temperature, corrosive, or sterile processes are severely hindered by material selection.  Currently, polymers are used for membranes with small molecular-weight cutoffs, while ceramics are applicable for larger contaminants.  In many cases, heat is used to drive the separation because membranes are insufficient to provide required rejection.  But, in the case of water desalination, membranes afford half to a quarter of the energy use per unit of water treated, illustrating the inherent inefficiencies of distillation or drying.

    This I-Corps project uses graphene oxide (GO) as a material platform with tunable chemistry to offer size-exclusion based membrane separation with increased robustness.  In addition to permeability, temperature stability and resilience to cleaning chemicals offer operational cost savings. This project previously built a fundamentally new way of assembling membranes by using chemical cross linkers between GO sheets in order to leverage the low feedstock cost of GO, the improved permeability of a nanoporous thin-film membrane, and the increased resilience to organic foulants.  Further, the production of these membranes was designed for manufacturing, incorporating only solution-based processes with analogues used in industry today.  In the current work, with a deep understanding of the chemistry and physics of graphene oxide through the lens of separation mechanisms, it is anticipated that this system can open up many exciting opportunities for rGO membranes in a number of important separations.

    The broader/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it provides a cost-effective, low-impact hybrid 'green' approach for addressing stormwater runoff, one of the leading causes of impairment to our nation's waters. These runoff problems are expected to be exacerbated, particularly in urban areas, as a result of the coupled impacts of future population growth-driven land use and cover changes and storm events associated with projected climate change. Recognition of these threats to our water resources, together with the increasing costs of conventional municipal water treatment, has led to interest in green infrastructure approaches for stormwater management.  However, in their current design, many of these green infrastructure systems are passive: their effectiveness for intercepting water and removing pollutants is highly variable.  The technology described here will provide stormwater engineers, developers, city managers, and homeowners with important design criteria that will maximize green infrastructure performance and functionality.  The commercialization of this hybrid green technology is therefore key for making it widely accessible to potential end-users to address both present and future stormwater/water resource challenges.

    This I-Corps project will assess the market potential and commercialization feasibility of a modular, hybrid stormwater management technology that augments green infrastructure both to maximize pollutant removal efficiency and allow for water storage.  The modular hybrid green infrastructure (MHGI) is a sealed system with a specialized pipe and valve assembly that allows for both the control of water retention times as well as the location of the subsurface water table height, so that intercepted stormwater can be held within the soil matrix at a depth to maximize aerobic/anaerobic conditions that promote bioremediation via plant and microbial processing. Stormwater storage times can be controlled and the system can be made operational to adjust for changes in historical or projected runoff volumes. The intercepted water can also be stored within the system, pending removal by evapotranspiration, or for reuse purposes such as irrigation.  Preliminary alpha testing of this technology demonstrated significant and consistent nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies with 88% nitrate and 100% phosphate removal observed for urban runoff, 95% total nitrogen and 81% phosphate removal observed for septic effluent, and 50% nitrate, 71% ammonium, and 55% removal observed for agricultural runoff.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes improved cancer diagnostics, more accurate personalized treatments, and reduced public health burden related to cancer. The project is aimed at commercializing acoustic-based cell sorting technologies and providing diagnostic and therapeutic devices, taking advantage of the estimated US $14 billion liquid biopsy market in the United States alone. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have already been established as important prognostic biomarkers in many tumor entities namely breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer. However, capture of viable CTCs at high purity from the peripheral blood of cancer patients still poses a significant technical challenge. The acoustic-based techniques are mostly promising, compared to other technologies, due to the inherent advantages in preserving the integrity, functionality, and viability of biological cells using label-free and contact-free sorting. The acoustic CTC isolation devices, once commercialized, can be used by cancer researchers to study cancer metastasis and discover new drugs, can be used by medical doctors for cancer diagnostics and prognosis evaluation, and can be used to develop personalized immunotherapies to increase the cure rate. As an example, the downstream analyses of the sorted and expanded patient-specific CTCs may significantly increase the response rate of the latest groundbreaking immunotherapeutic approaches.

    This I-Corps project aims to develop commercially viable acoustic cell sorting devices based on the latest microfluidics technologies developed in research. The term 'microfluidics' relates to miniaturized handling of fluidic samples of sub-microliter or lower volume by utilizing miniaturized structures ranging in micron or submicron dimensions. Miniaturization of conventional laboratory processes in microfluidic platforms using well-established microfabrication technology has drawn great attention, and led to the development of the so-called Lab-on-a-Chip devices. Lab-on-a-Chip aims at integration, miniaturization, parallelization, and automation of biochemical processes, performed into a small chip of a few square millimeters to a few square centimeters in size. The higher degree of automation and the reduced energy consumption renders such microfluidic devices excellent candidates for point of care (PoC) diagnostics. This team fabricated and tested a novel microfluidic platform using surface acoustic waves that can effectively filter out circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood samples of cancer patients. This is a generic capture scheme since CTCs are considered to be general biomarkers i.e., most cancer types shed CTCs in the bloodstream or the lymphatic system. This acoustic-based cell sorting platform is a promising method for capturing CTCs label-free and contact-free, preserving their inherent biological characteristics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on enhancing the reliability, longevity, security, and trustworthiness of the advanced metering infrastructure in smart grids. The integration of trustworthy information technology in the power grid will facilitate effective and efficient energy management in the presence of distributed generation with renewable sources. This team's technology, employing hardware-oriented security and trust, built-in self-test, and device authentication, can be applied to any industry that employs VLSI/FPGA chips and faces security risks. For example, this technology can be integrated into medical instrumentation in the health industry and dash-board chips in vehicles in the auto industry to make them more secure, reliable, and trustworthy.

    This I-Corps project is based on earlier NSF funded research in the area of hardware-oriented security and testing of digital/integrated circuits. Its application in smart meters overcomes current meters problems by providing remote re-configurability to accommodate current and future technology advancements and additional security. While there are multiple smart meter manufacturers in the US, this project's technology has a strong focus on hardware re-programmability (leading to increased longevity and expandability), reliability, and security of the system. Also, current smart meters are not easily updated as technology advances. The proposed meters provide high security, based on special hardware based techniques, and incorporate built-in self-test circuitry. Hardware-oriented security is implemented using physical unclonable functions which provide authentication and trust to the programmable chip and also establish the authenticity of the smart meter. The meters can also detect the presence of hardware Trojans, which can be implanted by untrusted manufacturers and foundries abroad, to steal information or hamper the functionality of the device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it presents a low cost, high quality, alternative to copper for electric power transmission and distribution. This project's new generation conductive polymer wire is durable, strong, light, and easy to manufacture cost-effectively. The new wire  is seen as a potential replacement for copper, which is heavy and a commodity subject to significant price instabilities.  This new technology could be disruptive in electric power industry. Lighter electronic devices will also be possible through this technology that could impact everything from portable devices to a reduction of the weight of automobiles and aircrafts. It also has the potential to revolutionize the current conductive polymer market.

    This I-Corps project proposes a technology that may replace copper in electric power distribution and transmission. The proposed technology is based on a newly discovered carbon-based polymer with excellent electrical conductivity comparable to that of copper. This new material is durable, light, strong, and highly conductive with a high melting point over 1000C. Electric wires and cables can be easily manufactured cost effectively using the powder-in-tube technique with a copper sheath. Feasibility assessment requires exploration into fabrication of flexible wires for easy installation and handling and for good connectivity with copper wires, as well as exploring the potential customer base for this technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on allowing a greater number of people with varying abilities to independently operate a power wheelchair. The kit developed with this project can also provide more independence by freeing up the hands from operating the wheelchair and allowing for the wheelchair to be operated within a specified range - even if the user is not seated in it.  This wireless control technology can be used to control other devices such as robots, travel scooters and adaptive sport devices. Using sensors that are already part of smart phones, and the software application including in the kit, a control device that is user friendly and cost effective is created. Expanding the concept of how humans control machines beyond a typical joystick can change the way society views wheelchairs and other mobile devices.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization of a hands free wheelchair control kit that can be used by power wheelchair users, including those with a spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy or poly trauma injuries.  The device is designed to allow power wheelchair users the ability to operate their wheelchair without the need to manipulate a joystick with their hands. A smartphone and its accelerometer sensors becomes the joystick by sending the control signals via Bluetooth to the controller of the wheelchair or any mobile device. The smartphone can be attached to the user's arm, head, chest, or remotely, to control the wheelchair. The kit is also designed to toggle between the wheelchair's original joystick controller and the customized smartphone controller using a switch. A wiring harness is used to connect the custom controller to the original controller of most wheelchair manufacturers for easy installation and operation. Preliminary work by the team has shown its capabilities as a successful control alternative to a joystick opening up wheelchair manipulation to a wider group of users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide computation infrastructure for building and scaling the Internet of Things (IoT) efficiently and quickly. The situation is similar to what happened with personal computer and mobile devices. These applications required specialized computation infrastructure to be provided before they could be mass produced and commercialized. Infrastructure vendors in the mentioned application spaces are large companies with enormous contributions to the economy and fundamental research in their respective fields. This project aims to follow in their footsteps in the emerging IoT markets with potential applications in self-driving cars, autonomous drones, advanced robotics, smart/green consumer electronics and medical devices. This will enable companies in these fields to focus their engineering efforts on their primary products and services without spending time on costly and long iterations to develop underlying infrastructure like high-performance control and communication systems.

    This I-Corps project will explore the possibility for the fundamental change in how engineering teams approach the design of high-performance control and communication systems in industry and academia. The project is based on a new design methodology, supporting infrastructure, e.g. new hardware and software architectures, and a set of design tools connecting them together into a coherent design ecosystem. Unlike the traditional approaches to computer-aided design, this approach does not base its tools on automation but rather on transparency. Automation is the standard objective to building design tools, but it often is not sufficient.  When a particular tool fails users are often left with no information to understand why and how to improve the situation, resulting in costly and long trial-and-error search for a solution. Focusing on transparency this approach can deliver tools which keep the user informed and aware of design tradeoffs, hence helping them to make informed decisions. This approach to design is the outcome of our previous research in hardware-software co-design and attempts to improve design efficiency.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is validating the value of using a comprehensive immune profiling technology to identify predictive biomarkers for streamlining clinical trial drug development. Targeted treatments can be very effective when matched with a responsive patient population. One way to increase treatment efficacy, reduce cost, and mitigate risk for therapies in clinical development is to sub-segment a patient population into likely responders and non-responders. This immune profiling technology has the potential to stratify patients this way by identifying predictive biomarkers that correlate with treatment. The project's focus is on immunotherapies and biologics for autoimmune diseases, two areas where the immune system activity is central to therapy success and avoidance of adverse side effects. By examining the immune profile of patients, this project hopes to identify mis-regulated cellular and gene pathways and therefore elucidate therapeutic efficacy in patients. Predicting patient response to therapies will streamline clinical trial drug approval, reduce healthcare costs on ineffective treatments, and ultimately, improve patient outcomes.

    This I-Corps project is based on a powerful sequencing-based immune profiling platform for patient stratification for applications in precision medicine and drug development. This technology enables high-throughput isolation and comprehensive transcriptional profiling of individual immune cells directly from microliters of whole blood. From the data generated, high-resolution, multi-scale immune profiles are developed that present a readout of the interactions across cell types and within individual cells. These unbiased and high-dimensional profiles provide three distinct tiers of information: 1) Cellular level: the frequency of each cell type observed, 2) Module level: the transcriptional programs for inflammatory and immune pathways and 3) Gene level: individual biomarkers within each cell type. In contrast to DNA sequencing, these measurements are sensitive to cellular heterogeneity and captures the genetic and environmental factors driving the dynamic processes of disease pathogenesis and response to drug therapy. This compact representation of the immune state will enable the identifcation of features of the immune profile that are predictive of disease, drug response, and more.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project ranges from discovery research in the biological and other life sciences to applications in laboratory and clinical medicine. The PVT1 non-protein coding gene is very important in both disease and non-disease biological states. This project is producing multiple novel tools potentially useful for research, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic applications. The new tools being developed have applications in bioimaging and discovery research and development, with impact extending beyond disease states where PVT1-derived non-coding RNAs and their molecular targets may be abnormal into non-disease states across the full spectrum of biological systems where PVT1-derived non-coding RNAs and their molecular targets may be relevant.

    This I-Corps project focuses on the non-coding gene locus, PVT1, located on the 8q24 chromosome. PVT1 is important in normal and abnormal biological states. PVT1 has at least 12 different exons and encodes six microRNAs, which are differentially expressed in prostate cancer (PCa). PVT1 exon 9 may be a biomarker of aggressive PCa, and microRNA-1207-3p has prognostic value in PCa, and regulates a new fibronectin domain containing 1 (FNDC1)/fibronectin (FN1)/androgen receptor (AR) molecular pathway that is associated with metastatic PCa. Consequently, PVT1 exon 9 primers (patent pending) were invented for detection of both cellular and cell-free PVT1 exon 9, and siRNAs (patent pending) that silence expression of PVT1 exon 9 and inhibit PCa tumor cell phenotypes were invented. For discovery of the molecular mechanisms of action of microRNA-1207-3p, a novel synthetic biotinylated microRNA-1207-3p duplex (patent pending) was invented. The usefulness of this novel synthetic biotinylated microRNA-1207-3p duplex in bioimaging, and inhibition of PCa tumor cell phenotypes has been demonstrated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project originates from the importance that minerals plays in our society. Energy and food security for a growing world population depend on improving our understanding of complex minerals such as shales and apatites. Key materials as different as concrete, coal and soil, all feature a key mineral component. Progress has occurred throughout the mineral industry, but decreasing quality of feedstocks and environmental concerns call for innovation in the sector. As an example, analytical testing of minerals reactivity still relies on traditional wet chemistry apparatus (e.g., beaker and volumetric flasks), which do not allow an accurate understanding of impurities and accessory components behavior. Such impurities often determine the performance of the processed material. Since the market of laboratory testing services accounts for US$7.1bn in the US, there is an evident opportunity for commercial development of analytical devices that can significantly improve accuracy of experimental data, minimize cost and environmental footprints.

    This I-Corps project focuses on the development of a microfluidic device to perform chemical reactions on surfaces of mineral samples. The device combines in one single platform both petrographic and wet chemistry analysis, and enhances the resolution of mineral/liquid investigations to the micrometer scale. Originally, the research was developed to study the release of agricultural nutrients from silicate minerals to the pores that occur naturally in soil. It was demonstrated that at the microscale the rate at which such release occurs is faster than previously thought. Subsequently, the potential of the technology for high throughput screening of geological samples for the oil and gas and mining industries was validated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on developing tools for the biomedical research community, in particular the discovery of proteins that are altered during the normal or abnormal functioning of cells, tissues and organisms. The term for this protein discovery field is proteomics.  Hundreds of thousands of proteomics samples are analyzed around the world annually. These innovations will significantly benefit the biomedical research community. These tools will allow scientists to understand complex processes such as how the microbiome affects behavior, how development is affected by genetic mutations, and how cancer cells change their behavior upon chemotherapy. The number of questions these tools can help address is limitless. All major research institutions have proteomics facilities that serve dozens to hundreds of researchers. These tools will be used both by individual research labs and proteomics core facilities, as well as contract research facilities and pharma companies.

    This I-Corps project addresses technological needs in the field of proteomics. A very large fraction of proteomics samples involve separating complex mixtures of different proteins into individual protein species by a process called gel electrophoresis, where electric currents are used to separate proteins by size and charge in thin slabs of gel material. This work concentrates on two key unmet needs. First is improving the detection sensitivity of proteins within electrophoresis gels. Convention detection instruments can detect proteins over a 1,000-fold concentration range, but proteins normally exist in cells over a million-fold range. The device developed here is capable of detecting proteins over a million-fold concentration range. The next unmet need is to efficiently transfer proteins from gels to a mass spectrometer, which is used to chemically characterize proteins. The method under development here will greatly increase the throughput of this process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from the ability to enhance the status of cells and tissues for more effective therapies in regenerative medicine to treat a variety of diseases.  Moreover, emerging drug treatments in areas such as cardiovascular disease and cancer can be optimized. This approach will be more efficient than direct and difficult-to-control animal studies.  Thus at a societal level, the proposed technology has the potential to rapidly bring robust treatments to millions of patients with critical health problems.  The commercial impact of this project is expected to be most substantial in the pharmaceutical and regenerative medicine industry wherein during the product development phase conventional animal studies which are very expensive and time-consuming can be significantly reduced.

    This I-Corps project focuses on a device that can grow cells and tissues under any combination of flow, stretch and flexure (FSF) mechanical loads.  The device, the FSF bioreactor system provides a platform for advanced cell biomanufacturing in regenerative medicine by regulating the fate of stem cells.  It can also be used as a cardiovascular model system to objectively evaluate the efficacy of pharmaceutical agents while being subjected to the mechanical conditions of the human circulation.  Under a combination of flow and cyclic flexure states as well as under pulsatile flow settings, the system has already demonstrated that stem cells convert to cells exhibiting cardiovascular characteristics.  Moreover, it has also been shown that the underlying driver of this conversion is oscillations in the fluid flow, which the FSF bioreactor is able to facilitate and regulate.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the provision of a scientifically-based, gender-specific, home-based, mobile health secondary prevention (SP) program for women with heart disease with greater access at a lower cost than current center-based SP programs. This application will overcome barriers to currently available center-based programs. The innovation will provide a solution to the healthcare triple aim of 1) improving quality of care; 2) improving population health; and 3) reducing per capita cost. The application is a timely business opportunity starting with a recurring software subscription model that will provide better service, at a lower cost to women with heart disease.

    This I-Corps project will translate the core modules of center-based secondary prevention (SP) into a comprehensive, patient-centered, gender-specific mobile health program for cardiovascular risk reduction including emotional and physical assessment, training videos, symptom monitoring, coaching and communication with a healthcare provider, and outcome evaluation. The intellectual merit of this project is evident in that the mobile innovation will incorporate theory-based behavior change techniques known to drive changes in health behaviors, demonstrate the intended behavior, tailored to women with heart disease versus apparently healthy individuals, and will undergo evaluation in a randomized clinical trial. The application incorporates self-monitoring, user selection of priority goals, motivational strategies and will requires less patient and staff time.

    The commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be that it will further develop a sensor to detect lung cancer without a bioposy and to give more specific diagnostics for this cancer thus enabling targeted drug therapy.  This will decrease the cost for treating cancer, improving survival rates of lung cancer, and provide less invasive and more accurate diagnostics. The technology is a platform technology to enable low cost effective tests for all diseases that cause the body to release neoantigens, anti-bodies, or DNA mutations. The developed sensor is more sensitive than existing sensors and will be able to detect the type of cancer in the blood of patients that have cancer.  This will potentially allow doctors to prescribe targeted drug therapy and will be able to detect cancer earlier, target a patient's cancer without needing a biopsy, and potentially lead to a higher survival rate.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a nanowire biosensor platform that is more sensitive than existing sensors and will be able to detect a type of lung cancer in the blood of patients. The nanowire biosensor platform is able to measure DNA at high sensitivities because it uses nanowires that have a very high surface area and are sensitive to the atmosphere around them. The proposed platform technology utilizes arrays of vertically aligned nanowires.  Using this device design, sensors with over a million nanowires per sensor have been developed by the team. The biosensor has been used for prostate specific antigen (PSA) detection and have positive preliminary results. This new method of detection enables sensors with nanowire arrays versus a single nanowire, resulting in higher sensitivity devices.

    Sperm quality determines a man's ability to conceive, but many men do not know their chances of having a baby or why they are infertile. This I-Corps team proposes to develop a technology that provides men a new way to assess their sperm quality and fertility. Ultimately, it helps the infertile couples that are seeking treatment options. Furthermore, assessing sperm quality is also important to sperm banks, fertility clinics, and farmers that produce livestock because the ability to select the best quality sperm leads to an increase in productivity and profit. Currently, only some aspects of sperm quality can be determined, and the proposed project expands the parameters of sperm analysis, leading to better sperm evaluation and identification of unrecognized infertility. Since the technology identifies a new type of infertility, it has the potential to be a disruptive innovation in the reproductive medicine market.

    One out of eight couples is infertile, affecting millions of people in the USA alone. With current technology, approximately 20% of these couples do not know the basis of their infertility and cannot attribute it to either the man or the woman. This rate of infertility describes a very broad and compelling market need. The technology provides physicians in fertility clinics the ability to identify whether male patients are infertile and predict the success of in vitro fertilization. Since treatments are usually not covered by insurance and have only a 25% chance of success, anything that can increase the predictability of success would be an important way to maintain physicians' reputations and success ratios. Other potential market areas might be agricultural; farms that breed livestock such as turkey, dairy cattle, and pigs, by using artificial insemination. This technology would provide the farmer a diagnostic tool to assess semen quality to increase agricultural productivity. Furthermore, sperm banks could use our technology to predict the quality of the sperm they sell. Overall the technology would significantly enhance the assessment of sperm quality and capability to produce a healthy baby or offspring. Using I-Corps funding this team will determine specific areas where the proposed technology can be utilized.  In order to investigate the customers' needs, such as accuracy level, price, and ease of use, this team will look for potential customers who have experienced the current technology and customers who are not satisfied with the current technology.

- abstractText: "Parasitic nematodes, also known as roundworms, are significant agricultural
    pests, causing economic losses in the hundreds of billions of dollars for food
    crops, and tens of billions for livestock. They also pose a significant problem
    for pet health in the industrialized world, and more important, human health in
    the developing world. In 2011, sales of the anti-nematode drug Ivermectin exceeded
    $1 billion. Unfortunately current solutions are becoming obsolete due to emerging
    resistance to existing drugs, and increasingly stringent environmental regulations.
    New pesticides and drugs are needed to prevent nematode damage to crops, animals
    and humans, and this represents a potentially significant economic opportunity
    we hope to address.  This I-Corps team has developed a process that can be used
    to identify chemical compounds that kill nematode pests in a novel way. In addition,
    the proposed method can be selective, in that the compounds developed for commercial
    use can be active against nematodes, and be inactive against humans and other
    animals. This differentiation will allow users to reduce the environmental toxicity
    of anti-nematode compounds, a key obstacle to pesticide use today. \n\nThe overall
    goals of this project are to develop and commercialize new chemical compounds
    that can be used to combat parasitic nematodes in agricultural, veterinary, and
    human health applications. The team's approach is to screen chemical libraries
    for compounds that can activate parasite target proteins required for neuronal
    or muscular function. Exposure to the compound will cause lethal disruption of
    nematode physiology, which should prevent establishment and promote clearance
    of nematode infestations. Unfortunately, direct screening of parasitic nematodes
    is impractical because they are very difficult to culture and genetically manipulate
    in the lab. To meet this challenge the team has created an innovative method that
    involves screening genetically engineered laboratory nematodes (C. elegans) expressing
    parasite targets, such that target activation causes paralysis (an easy to score
    phenotype amenable to automated screening). ). In contrast to more traditional
    methods, which utilize cultured mammalian cells, the proposed screen ensures that
    compounds will be active within the nematode physiological context (i.e. the target
    is integrated into its normal signaling pathways, and the compound can penetrate
    the nematode protective cuticle, and is thus bio-available).  Customer discovery
    interviews during the I-Corps program will help the team refine and focus these
    goals to fill existing market needs for new anti-nematode compounds. The potential
    contribution of this work will be to bring one new anti-nematode compound to the
    market, but perhaps more importantly, establish an ongoing pipeline for the discovery
    and commercialization of future anti-nematode compounds to optimally fit specific
    market needs in agriculture, veterinary medicine, and human medicine, and to keep
    ahead of resistance as it emerges."

    This project addresses automated, adaptive-rehabilitation and training assessment for victims of neurological disorders that impact motor functions.

    As the population ages and survival rates post-stroke increase, there is a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of motor therapy.  This I-Corps team's goal is to improve arm and hand function following neurological disorders that affect the motor system, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). This I-Corps team has developed a new device, MOTION-REACH, that provides automated and high-intensity arm motor training based on continuous accurate measurements of hand path and arm/trunk kinematics acquired from a 3D camera. This allows for objective assessment of reaching performance, minimization of compensatory movements, and adaptive training. Adaptive training with MOTION-REACH is intuitive and can be performed by patients alone or in a semi-supervised clinical environment. MOTION-REACH also provides fast, high-precision, and validated assessments. Session-by-session reports and overall reports for the patient, the therapist, and the health insurance provider are generated and saved on a database in the cloud.

    The MOTION-REACH device will expand therapist time availability because the device can be used by an unsupervised patient and does not require 1-to-1 supervision by the therapist, as it automatically monitors and prompts patients to perform movements correctly. Customer segments will include hospital-based and private physical therapy clinics. The device can be sold into the private patient marketplace, to be used in-home by private-pay patients under the remote guidance of a physical therapist.  The value proposition for the therapist derives from the ability to have patients performing highly effective therapeutic exercises without direct therapist supervision. The value proposition for the patient and the patient's medical insurance provider is that optimal and sustainable improvement is achieved in fewer therapy sessions than with traditional stroke recovery and other therapy techniques. This team's long-term goal is to develop personalized neurorehabilitation, similar to the successful drug dosing control in clinical pharmacology.

    The goal of this project is to create a technology to assist in 1) fish lure selection, 2) lure development and sales, and 3) ecological management.  The initial focus is on largemouth bass, the most popular sportfish in the United States (an estimated 12-18 million anglers).  The underlying technology, however, will be applicable to many other fish species and aquatic animals.  For the angler (user base #1), lure selection is critical to success and enjoyment.  Because fish see quite differently than humans, and their visual perception varies dramatically depending on lighting environments and habitat, the human eye cannot predict how bass will perceive a lure.  To improve the fishing experience, this I-Corps team will create an application that allows anglers to estimate how a given lure appears to bass in a given environment, and estimates the maximum distance at which a bass can see the lure.  For the lure manufacturer (user base #2), the technology can be used to develop lures with known levels of perception targeted for specific habitats?not only increasing the success of the lures but also adding significant marketing advantages.  In the field of animal management and conservation (user base #3), the technology ultimately promises a greater understanding of perception among a variety of species, leading to better decisions and practices to preserve and enhance ecosystems.

    Recreational angling is a multi-billion dollar industry, and largemouth bass are the most popular target for anglers. An estimated $6.1 billion is spent annually just on rods, reels, tackle boxes, etc. Another $100 million is spent on fishing magazines, books, and DVDs. 11.2 million people fish for black bass annually, and another 7.3 million fish for related sunfish species. At this time the team is not aware of any product on the market that take a scientific approach to estimating how bass perceive objects in their environment, or that use the knowledge base of fish vision capabilities to make effective lures. Participation in the I-Corps program will enable the team to investigate the market from many viewpoints. The team will learn what channels lures and fish attraction products take from manufacture to user in the recreational market area. The team also needs to connect with all types of recreational anglers, as well as commercial fisherman. If fish can be caught by specific lures based on the knowledge of their visual systems, it could mean that using fish specific lure systems in a commercial setting could eliminate the gathering of non-target species of all kinds, called the by-catch, preventing the situation in which fish other than those desired are collected via the fishing methods used, and then discarded as waste. At the end of the project, the team will decide if a SBIR would be useful to obtain, and also gain insight into what business entity or license strategy to use for commercial market entry.

    To regain the use of limbs following traumatic injury, severe peripheral nerve injuries require surgical intervention. Approximately 200,000 repair surgeries are carried out in the U.S. every year. However, with current strategies, few patients reach a full functional recovery. Currently, the preferred intervention takes 'less important' nerve from the patient to aid regeneration at the site of injury, leading to multiple surgical sites and tissue morbidity. Therefore, there is a clear need for synthetic nerve guidance channels to effectively replace the use of patients' own tissue. The advantages of the proposed technique to produce nerve guidance channels are a consistent high yield and internal fiber features that are defined on the macroscale, reducing the need for expensive microfabrication techniques. This team has harnessed this materials processing technique to work with biologically relevant polymers as well as incorporating features including electrodes and topography to enhance tissue growth. The proposed guidance channels have shown promise for guiding and enhancing the rate of nerve growth, but much work both on the technical and business side of this project is required to translate this technology to the market and ultimately to patients.

    This team's current hypothesis is that the end user for the proposed technology will be the patient and the primary customer will be the surgeon who implants the device. Additional stakeholders may be, but are not limited to: procurement officers, primary care physicians, and/or hospital technology officers.  The I-Corps program and aggressive customer discovery will be paramount in identifying the key stakeholders involved in all aspects of commercialization, including product production, customer acquisition, and end usage.  The team aims to use the I-Corps program process to build its understanding of customers and value propositions by interviewing 80-q100 stakeholders, and also plan to expand further the material library to further improve the biocompatibility and efficacy of the nerve guidance channels.

    This Innovation Corps (I-Corps) project incorporates virtual reality technology in training and education for green energy.

    The United States Green Energy sector has seen multi-billion dollar investments in the past decade with an intention to reduce dependency on oil and coal and curb greenhouse gas emissions. As such, there is a constant demand for a qualified workforce to fill the open job positions in this industry sector. The challenge in this market is that the current infrastructure for training students, technicians, and engineers falls short to meet this demand as traditional methods to teach green energy technologies requires huge dollar investments in hardware (solar panels, wind turbines, hydro-electric setups), labs, qualified teachers/trainers, and  field trips. The proposed innovation addresses this challenge by providing a web-based software system that uses a combination of desktop based Virtual Reality technology and low-cost computer hardware technologies for green energy and environmental engineering literacy and training. Once commercialized successfully, the proposed innovation is expected to provide learners in schools, universities, community colleges, and training companies, with digital and scientific skills training for entry-level job positions in the clean energy sector at a fraction of current costs. This will ultimately help fulfill the demand for an appropriately trained and qualified workforce in the rapidly growing clean energy sector in United States.

    From a technical perspective, the main goal of this project is to design, develop, test, and commercialize a cloud-based software system that uses modern desktop virtual reality (VR) technology and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm to teach topics in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This goal is achieved by leveraging VR software and low-cost open-source hardware to connect via wirelesss (Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy, and Wi-Fi technologies) and wired fast-Ethernet technologies. The results obtained from this work will contribute to the ongoing challenges that span VR for education, IoT technologies, and network requirements and behavior for next generation Internet applications. There are several possible customer segments with common needs. One is academic institutions such as research and teaching universities, community colleges across the US, and high schools and middle schools that need to educate their students in the fields of green energy and environmental engineering. Another segment might be parents of 8-14 year old children who want their children to be digitally and scientifically literate in the aforementioned areas. The team's goal with the I-Corps is to quickly identify the most profitable sub-segment(s)in the two possible customer segments and design go-to-market strategies for the sub-segment(s). As such, the team would like to calibrate its pricing models by taking into account different revenue models such as Software-as-a-Service or one-time purchase.

    This Innovation Corps Project focuses on a technology to reduce the impacts of age-related macular degeneration.

    Degradation of the photoreceptor cells of the retina is a symptom of various underlying conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). As the American population ages, AMD is expected to reduce the mobility and quality of life for large population of citizens. These diseases impact nearly 15 million Americans and there are few options to slow vision loss and no direct treatments. The proposed technology, the Molecular Artificial Retina (MAR), is a potential treatment for these conditions and offers great hope to people who have lost one of the most important senses for mobility and independence. The technology acts to make cells in the retina more sensitive to less light. Current treatment is limited to nutrition and behavioral changes to slow progression. The anticipated mode of delivery is an injectable; that is, injected into the photoreceptor-degenerate eye to embed in the membrane of surviving retinal neurons, imparting light sensitivity.

    During the NSF I-Corps program, this I-Corps team will identify and establish relationships with potential partners across the medical field.  The team's goal is to reach the final stage of commercialization, involving manufacturing, clinician/patient marketing, and distribution.  The team anticipates generating revenues from three distinct customer segments: 1) from patients who purchase the proposed treatment out-of-pocket; 2) from doctors (in particular ophthalmologists) who use the proposed treatment and seek reimbursement from private medical insurance; and 3) from doctors who seek reimbursement from Medicare.

    Most network operators in IT departments are trained in configuring routers, but are not necessary programmers. With the emergence of Software-Defined Networks (SDN), there is a need for network operators to program routers, which they may not have the skill set for. The proposed technology (NetEgg) provides a way for IT operators who are not trained in software programming, to program the behavior of their SDN routers simply by supplying example scenarios visually.  The proposed tool takes the visual scenarios and then automatically generates a working code.

    During the I-Corps program, this team's customer discovery plan involves interviewing router vendors, large enterprises using software-based routers within data centers, and companies deploying policy-based routing over the wide-area. The proposed engineering plan involves developing a cloud-based NetEgg tool, where users can enter a visual representation of their network policy via a web-based interface, and actual router configurations will be dynamically propagated to network routers via secure channels.  By the end of the I-Corps program, the team also plans to have a demo available via which users can log into a NetEgg portal, to create scenarios, which can then by dynamically pushed down to registered SDN switches via a secure channel.

- abstractText: "Microfluidic systems are increasingly being used in diagnostics and
    therapeutics of several human diseases. They hold tremendous promise for low-cost,
    point-of-care diagnosis of various types of cancer and HIV, for instance. Key
    to the success of such systems is the ability to precisely control and manipulate
    individual blood cells. While their design so far is largely based on heuristics
    and exhaustive lab testing, new predictive computer simulation tools are emerging.
    Current commercial software packages provide excellent simulation tools to analyze
    flow of simple (Newtonian) fluids through any given microfluidic device. However,
    in the case of flows involving deformable particles such as cells, bubbles or
    capsules, their scope is extremely limited. Based on recent advances in numerical
    algorithms, this project will develop novel simulation technology capable of simulating
    realistic blood cell concentrations, enabling rapid prototyping of microfluidic
    devices. Thereby, this project has the potential to drive further innovations
    in low-cost diagnostic tools and patient-specific therapeutic strategies. \n\nThe
    main difficulty with particulate flow simulations lies in the fact that the hydrodynamic
    interactions are long-range, thereby, leading to high computational expense. Furthermore,
    the time-stepping schemes suffer from loss of accuracy and stability due to nearly
    touching surfaces that vary in time as the particles flow. The solvers developed
    by this I-Corps team are already capable of (i) computing the interactions between
    cells and channels in linear time via the use of fast N-body algorithms, (ii)
    delivering results with high-fidelity via the use of spectrally-accurate numerical
    methods and (iii) performing long-time simulations via the use of stiffness-overcoming
    time-marching schemes. The primary goal of this project is to build a simulation
    suite that works for any given chip geometry, boundary conditions and cellular
    concentrations."

    Radiopharmaceutical therapy is a type of cancer therapy that delivers short-range radiation specifically to a tumor or to tumor cells distributed in the body as metastases without delivering too much radiation to normal tissue.  This type of treatment is an alternative to chemotherapy and it has worked well in patients with lymphoma and was recently FDA approved for patients with late-stage, metastatic prostate cancer.  By imaging the radiation emitted by the radiopharmaceutical, it is possible to measure how much radiation goes to tumors and to normal tissue.  This information can be used to adjust the dose given so that the patients are not under (not enough tumor radiation to kill the tumor) or overdosed (too much radiation to normal tissue that leads to side effects).  Such an individualized dosing approach requires that a test dose be administered first and that patient images of the radiopharmaceutical in the body be collected and then used to calculate the radiation dose to the tumor and to different organs.  The radiation dose information for the test dose can then be used to administer a larger therapy dose so that the best possible treatment is given to each patient. This "treatment planning" process requires sophisticated data analysis that the proposed team has developed over many years.  This type of analysis is not easily available and radiopharmaceutical treatment has often been given without the individualized dosing described above.  This team hopes to establish a commercial service that will provide the analysis required to deliver radiopharmaceutical therapy to patients without over- or under-dosing them.  The proposed Radiopharmaceutical Imaging and Dosimetry (RAPID) service will ultimately benefit cancer patients by making available a treatment that targets metastatic cancer and that in many cases is more effective and has fewer side effects than chemotherapy.

    This I-Corps team proposes to commercialize a start-up (RadioPharmaceutical Imaging and Dosimetry - RAPID) for expert quantitative imaging/dosimetry services towards radiopharmaceutical therapy development/commercialization.  Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) is an emerging cancer treatment that delivers radiation directly to tumors. Clinicaltrials.gov lists > 100 trials investigating this modality; > 20 pharmaceutical companies are working in RPT, including Roche/Genentech, and Bayer/Algeta.  The recent FDA approval of 223Ra (Xofigotm) for resistant prostate cancer highlights the potential of RPT.  FDA approval of RPT requires tumor and organ dose estimates. European regulations mandate personalized dosimetry. There are no commercial resources to provide these calculations. Pharmaceutical companies have contracted the Sgouros (Radiopharmaceutical-Dosimetry) lab (RDL) for dosimetry of RPT agents under development.  RDL has also been contacted by numerous institutions running trials of such agents.  The Frey lab has licensed quantitative imaging software to GE.  There is future potential for combining RPT therapy with external beam radiation therapy or other RPT agents, and the RDL has developed technology for rationally combining these modalities. This team has formulated specific hypotheses regarding likely clients and the value proposition for RAPID and propose to test them via the I-Corps program.  Specifically, members of the team will travel to company sites and conduct face to face interviews with previously identified potential clients to ask them questions that will allow us to test the assumptions that we have made regarding value proposition and potential client base.  Potential clients will be interviewed based on personal contacts of the team members that have been acquired over many years of doing radiopharmaceutical therapy imaging and dosimetry research.

    Markets for 3D printers and related materials are expanding rapidly, with the potential to fundamentally transform manufacturing practices. The proposed project will offer the 3D printing community a low cost, mobile-friendly solution for quality analysis of parts made by additive manufacturing. Understanding the inevitable variations between design and production is an important step in process improvement and innovation. This I-Corps team is creating an open source software system to compare scans of 3D printed objects with their digital designs, presenting the results in a visually rich, interactive form on mobile devices. Current offerings focus on expensive proprietary software and hardware, limiting participation and technical contributions by a vibrant and rapidly changing community. This team's open source solution is designed to connect users throughout the 3D printing world and use their experiences to grow better and more innovative technologies and techniques through quality analysis. The product will provide a powerful tool for evaluation to small companies, researchers, and members of the growing maker community.

    The proposed project adds statistical measures and a workflow derived from X-ray tomography to an existing open source visualization app that runs on handheld tablets and smartphones. The goal is to compare the digital form of the 3D model as sent to the 3D printer with a 3D measurement of the actual printed object as obtained with available scanning technology. A quantitative comparison of a design's digital model with the point-cloud or surface data generated by one of these scans can reveal important qualitative results. The product will display results based on the type and precision of the scanning technology used, such as laser-based metrology scans, X-ray and CT scans, and physical metrology systems. The statistical workflow and visualization software will be tabulated and rendered on a workstation or server, and presented using a version of Kitware's KiwiViewer that the team has customized for the application. The proposed system will be distributed open source, providing quality analysis to growing numbers of small companies, researchers, and artisans, delivered to mobile devices and desktops alike. A vibrant open source community in a rapidly changing field like 3D printing can drive a great deal of technical and market innovation. While the scope of the current project is to demonstrate existing quality examination techniques in a highly usable form, the potential exists to utilize the community's experiences to explore and improve numerous materials, techniques, and aspects of structure used in additive manufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is related to a wider use of superhydrophobic admixtures and concrete with enhanced durability. This approach is expected to lead to a highly effective method for improving the durability of concrete, especially concrete with large volumes of industrial by-products such as fly ash and slag used as cement replacements.  New superhydrophobic admixtures enable extending the service life of concrete structures, save raw materials and energy, and reduce the environmental impacts associated with construction; these features are essential for future durable and resilient civil and transportation infrastructure. In order to boost concrete durability, thisp roject aims to incorporate the proposed admixture into concrete as a component of the mixture (the approach used for new concrete) or as a surface treatment (the option for concrete repair). This project will explore the feasibility of a family of superhydrophobic products tailored for these two large-volume markets. Ultimately, the proposed approach will improve the performance of concrete structures while substantially decreasing the maintenance costs compared to standard practices.

    This I-Corps project aims to test the business model hypotheses and verify the commercial potential of admixtures for high-performance concrete. The superhydrophobic admixture combines the emulsified hydrogen containing siloxane precursor and small quantities of submicron-sized particles. When added to fresh concrete, the developed admixture releases hydrogen and forms very small air voids evenly distributed within the cement paste. The resulting concrete is water resistant, improving concrete resilience and durability. The developed superhydrophobic coatings applied on existing concrete render it water repellant and also ice-phobic, reducing ice adhesion.

    this project will allow for the scaling and commercialization of STEM Equity Audits
    (STEM-EAs). STEM-EAs identify and confront inequities specifically in mathematics
    and science activities within schools and districts. In many schools, Caucasian
    and male students are overrepresented in advanced STEM classes while minority
    and female students are more likely to be enrolled in remedial STEM classes. The
    enrollment, success and completion rates from STEM programs follow similar trends.
    \ STEM-EAs measure the climate for underrepresented STEM students, and help understand
    why they may not choose STEM classes and programs. STEM-EAs also consider how
    different contexts influence standardized assessment disparities. This is accomplished
    by collecting data from multiple sources including: school/district/county/State/Federal
    data; surveys of parents, students, teachers, and administrators; and data around
    policies that impact equity in district/schools. STEM-EAs look at inequities across
    comparison schools with similar demographics and curricular standardization to
    further understand how math and science classroom practices are inequitable. STEM-EAs
    not only identify where disparities exist, but also the reasons these inequities
    exist. \n\nThis project has potential to advance knowledge along the lines for
    STEM equity work in K-12 environments. Little is known about how STEM inequities
    are reproduced in schools, despite the fact that educators and administrators
    are aware of the gaps. STEM-EAs would allow school administrators to isolate and
    identify factors contributing to the inequities, and then initiate specific reforms
    based on data. This knowledge skill has the potential to change the STEM pipeline
    in districts using this tool. While equity audits are increasingly used in districts
    as a way to address all inequities in school, and have included discipline specific
    metrics, STEM-EAs are conducted with the sole purpose of addressing students'
    access to STEM classes and activities."

    Legacy award EEC 0530588 included a focus on teaching electrical and computer engineering (ECE) system design. To support system design thinking and learning, the project utilized student-designed interactive competitive activities. The current I-Corps L project expands on this and other awards to connect students in electrical and computer engineering programs across the country through mobile interactive competition design projects. The project seeks to create a nation-wide capstone program for ECE students, similar to exhibitions in other disciplines that are collaborative rather than competitive. Small-scale trials at Bucknell demonstrated the potential of this type of design for engaging students and teaching elements of system design across all levels of abstraction.

    The intent of this project is to link these competitive activities with learning since in order to compete, students have to create hardware and software. Since the competitive activity is integrally tied to design, the project has the potential to create rapid feedback on design choices, thus leading to more effective system design skills.  Additionally, the project may opt to develop a commercial activity for purchase. Initial trials conducted to date reveal unique affordances between competitive activities and engineering design. The interactive competitions depend as much upon stories and rules as the physical infrastructure (hardware and software) that supports play. Such activities have been defined as formal rule-based systems with variable and quantifiable outcomes in which different outcomes have different values to players. Players exert effort by both optional and negotiable activities to achieve favorable outcomes which brings an emotional stake. It is the player-centered and engaging characteristics of these competitive activities the project seeks to combine with the engineering design process. More specifically, the activities allow great flexibility in student design challenges so they become more adaptable to institution-specific learning outcomes and curricula. Changing the rules can significantly change the design parameters so that a large range of design projects are enabled even with a cost-effective and limited set of hardware and software. Furthermore, the activities can be placed in narratives drawn from many popular works relevant to STEM students and other learners, and thus have potential appeal to many audiences.

    speech/gesture-based applications to be executed by robots, and allows non-expert
    robot users to access (from the app store) and use (through natural communication

    about how to respond (specified by the developer for the application), and act
    based on those decisions while also providing its own speech and body language.
    This natural communication interface increases the usability of robots by novice
    users. \n\nThe Semio software platform involves novel algorithms and robust code
    bases that enable a robotic hardware platform to operate \"out of the box\" based
    on a set of core social behaviors that serve as building blocks of face-to-face
    conversational interaction; these behaviors include speech (what is said), eye
    gaze (where attention is focused), gestures (face, head, body, arm, and hand movements),
    turn-taking (when to talk and when to listen), and interpersonal spacing (where
    to stand for to have a conversation). The target market for the proposed speech/gesture-based

    such as smart devices (smart phones, GPS, and the Internet of Things), gaming,
    transportation (cars and self-driving cars), sensors (Microsoft Kinect and Intel

    The team is currently targeting customers who are hardware and software developers
    of these interactive technologies. Developers may be both expert and non-expert,
    and may be members of industry, the Maker community, hobbyists, or academia. Through
    repeated customer interviews, this team will continue to integrate customer feedback
    into the demo app to better improve the product content and performance to meet
    the identified needs of customers. The software platform will also be connected
    to a hardware robot platform to begin proof-of-concept demonstrations to and connection-building
    with prospective customers in the robotics market."

    Within the biological scientific community, having access to high quality data is essential for producing reliable results that contribute to an understanding of life and nature. Billions of dollars have been invested each year to generate such data. However, the pace at which data is being generated far outstrips the scientific community's ability to locate the best data for a given project.  The traditional method of waiting for peer-reviewed publications to be text-mined so a researcher can then search via PubMed to locate interesting conclusions is too slow. Thus, a new approach is needed to accelerate the search, find, and analysis process that is at heart of scientific inquiry. The proposed technology, OmicSeq, addresses this by extracting signal directly from raw data thus avoiding the publication cycle, which itself can be biased and typically reflects only a fraction of the value of the data. Moreover, researchers seeking quality data can exploit the search portal offered by OmicSeq to rapidly identify publicly available (or privately generated) data sets known to be correlated to a give gene or pathway query. In effect OmicSeq does for biological data what Google has done for web pages-find the data that is most closely related to genomic query. This accelerates the research cycle and allows investigators to reuse and re-examine repository data that would otherwise go unused. OmicSeq saves the researcher time (therefore money), and helps to make more use out of the data that has been generated.

    This I-Corps team plans to market the OmicSeq system using the software-as-a service (SaaS) business model. While a basic version of OmicSeq will be provided free online, the team will make majority of the database and data mining tools available only to customers who pay an annual licensing fee. A similar model has been adopted by numerous bioinformatics service providers. This team expects to attract customers in academic, industry as well as research institutes and government agencies. In surveying university research institutions, this team has determined that annual site licenses run in the range from $20,000 to $50,000 depending upon the degree of access offered. However, the team is actively conducting research to determine what the appropriate licensing costs would be to pharmaceutical companies since they typically pay a much higher license fee for at least two reasons: 1) pharmaceutical companies have private data;  thus security is of utmost importance. 2) the magnitude of data can be much larger than the publicly processed data sources that comprise the base offering of OmicSeq. Most of the proposed work at this point relates to accurately assessing the pharmaceutical market.

    Work with animals is very valuable for society. Animals as pets provide companionship and well documented health benefits. Zoos and aquariums are often public cultural institutions, and licensed animal exhibitors can be found in all the major cities in the United States. Research on drugs, behavior, and development require the use of live animals. For example, by law a drug cannot be brought to market without testing on live animals. For each of these valuable ways animals help us, there is a heavy workload of animal care and data collection. When the workload cannot be met, animals from home pets to zoo favorites suffer from a lower quality of life, and the value of what we get from animals is reduced. Heavy workloads lead to poor data, fewer pets, and sad looking zoo animals. The proposed project focuses on a system, similar to a video game system, that allows for automation of animal-related activities. This proposed system can give animals physical toys and puzzles to keep them busy, provide fun challenges for them to solve, and reward them for physical exercise all of which help keep the animals physically and mentally healthy. It will also provide new ways for people to bond with their pets, automatically conduct experiments, and record data.

    The goal of this I-Corps project is to identify the market need for devices which can improve animal welfare and automate data collection. This team will extensively interview in three potential market areas: pet owners, research laboratory decision makers, and zoo & aquarium staff. As the team members explore the market need, they will tailor their prototype system to meet market needs. The team will utilize the Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center at Texas A&M University to field test and scientifically validate the prototypes, then revisit their market areas with a product demonstration. If successful, they will develop a low cost, simple to use system that will allow animal caretakers, exhibitors, and researchers to automate much of their animal research and husbandry tasks. In this way the team will allow 1) pet owners to keep their animals busy and happy when they are away and to derive more benefits from pet ownership, 2) researchers to more efficiently and economically provide enrichment and run experiments, and 3) zookeepers to develop new interactive displays and provide highly stimulating activities for their animals. The team envisions the new device will work in the following way: load a game file, fill the object dispenser, and walk away knowing the system will exercise, entertain, feed, teach, research, or medicate the animal.

    There has been increasing concern of infections related to visit to hospitals, called hospital-acquired infections (HAIs).  HAIs have resulted in significant cases of mortality.  Approximately fifty percent of such susceptible to death circumstances are related to not properly cleaning (or disinfecting) the surfaces such as hospital beds, hospital room floors, and medical devices.  The common disinfectants used are bleach (i.e. sodium hypochlorite), hydrogen peroxide, and salt containing central positively charged nitrogen atom surrounded by four organic groups (or quaternary salts).  These disinfectants can clean the surfaces effectively, but in performing their disinfection functions destroy hospital equipment and materials.  In additions, these disinfectants have off putting odor and also cause irritation to eyes and skin to end users.  In this proposal, a liquid ferrate molecule, which is based on iron and oxygen atoms, is proposed to address the problems associated with currently used disinfectants.  In the laboratory, ferrate has shown tremendous potential to inactivate a wide range of microorganisms.  A recent patented liquid ferrate technology, which solved the inherent issues related to stability of ferrate in solution from, will be tested for its commercial viability as a surface disinfectant. The successful implementation of ferrate technology will decrease the cost burden to hospitals by applying safer approaches

    Ferrate has been shown to be an effective oxidant, coagulant, and disinfectant for treating water and wastewater. Significantly, ferrate is a capable disinfectant due to its ability to inactivate a wide variety of microorganisms at a low dosage. Most of the research on ferrate as a disinfectant has been carried out in an aqueous environment.  Ferrate has potential in disinfecting surfaces that carry several harmful bacteria that cause HAIs.  However, no study has been performed on ferrate as a potential surface disinfectant.  This I-Corps team's main approach is to evaluate disinfection capabilities of ferrate on environmental surfaces, especially in healthcare settings.  In the proposed work, two methodologies will be applied to seek the applicability of ferrate as a disinfectant in healthcare settings.  Initially, the intensive market evaluation of surface disinfectants will be done, followed by best practice to commercialize the liquid ferrate product as a surface disinfectant for healthcare facilities.  The market evaluation will provide information whether the ferrate technology stands in comparison with currently available market disinfectant products to the health care facility customers.  Finally, the physical properties (i.e., staining of surfaces/clothes/skin, odor) and interactions with hospital materials (e.g., glass, fabric, ceramic, metal, and plastic) will be examined after the ferrate treatment.  Evaluations include visual inspection, photographs, silk tests, smell, and discoloration of material.  The proposed successful systematic investigations on technological feasibilities and market evaluation of liquid ferrate product to clean surfaces of health care facilities will demonstrate the feasibility of ferrate technology to the health care facilities.

- abstractText: "Electronically commutated motors (ECMs) are used widespread in several
    applications including heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems,
    cooling and refrigeration units. The conventional way of control and diagnostics
    of ECMs in existing systems have been done manually and require interruption of
    regular operation of these units. This increases the associated cost and time
    for maintenance, control and diagnostics of ECMs. This proposal requests support
    to commercialize a wireless data acquisition system that has been developed for
    control and diagnostics of electronically commutated motors (ECMs) that can lead
    to energy and cost savings with improved electric machine parameters. The proposed
    technology provides several benefits including cost and energy savings, and eliminates
    the need for the manual control and periodic maintenance of ECMs.  The proposed
    technology will facilitate significantly the maintenance of these units in millions
    of HVAC systems, refrigeration and cooling units by providing wireless access
    to ECM parameters for collection of the required machine performance parameters.
    \ \n\nThe innovation in the proposed technology introduces Bluetooth communication
    with novel antenna implementation into ECMs while they are in an enclosure and
    enables wireless communication to overcome this challenge. This is done with the
    design and implementation of novel and modular radio frequency (RF) interface
    circuit which is powered from the existing power electronics control circuitry
    of ECM in motor housing without impeding upon its performance. The novel RF circuit
    can be interfaced with the existing ECM systems or integrated during the manufacturing
    process. The accuracy of the communication is enhanced by using the reciprocal
    frequency counter method.  This technology makes conventional ECM a \"smart\"
    ECM and gives them wireless communication capability with smart phones which have
    android or IOS software platforms. The proposed technology has potential customer
    groups including  OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), service providers,
    distributors, and industrial, commercial automation and control providers for
    HVAC systems, refrigeration and cooling units. The funding will help the I-Corps
    project team to explore the areas further to expand the customer base and identify
    accurately the potential customers in the groups to have the right business model
    and plan execution."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable the commercialization of the carbon dots technology, with the initial focus on uses in high-performance sensors for water and food analyses and in imaging techniques for the early detection of cancers and other biomedical applications. Carbon dots have been developed as nontoxic and environmentally benign alternatives to the commercially available semiconductor quantum dots, which are nanomaterials of excellent optical properties but mostly containing highly toxic heavy metals in order to achieve the desired properties and performance levels. With similarly excellent properties and high performance, carbon dots as carbon-based nanomaterials can be produced from abundant and environmentally friendly precursors. They are benign and nontoxic.  Because of the low-cost nature, the carbon dots technology is also expected to have broader applications beyond the initial focus for many other societal needs.

    This I-Corps project assesses the market potential and the likely customer base for a carbon dots technology. Carbon dots have emerged as a rapidly advancing and expanding field of research and development. Under the umbrella of the carbon dots technology, significant applications in a number of technological areas have been explored, including carbon dots as extremely sensitive, yet benign and nontoxic, optical probes, potent photocatalysts, photodynamic agents for therapy and other purposes, antibacterial and antiviral agents, and materials and components in various renewable energy and energy conversion devices. The focus of this project is on the technology for imaging and sensing to take advantage of the most important and uniquely advantageous characteristics and properties of carbon dots, specifically on several high-value uses for immediate commercial development.

    Based on principles of Mobile Crowd-Sensing, this project implements a Public Safety application for tracking children.

    Child protection is a critical global public safety issue.  Keeping track of young children is often a daunting task for parents.  The responsibility is especially challenging for parents with special-needs children. One social effort to track missing children, the AMBER Alert Program, focuses on galvanizing an entire community to assist in the search for and safe recovery of missing children. While the AMBER Alert Program's coverage of social monitoring has significantly broadened in recent years, including phone messaging and online social media, successful recoveries are often far too slow, the success rate is very low, and the process is costly. This team's technology automates aspects of AMBER Alert and radically improves the effectiveness through innovative wireless and cloud technologies.

    This project effectively and efficiently utilizes crowds to protect children using technology that provides a faster, better, and less expensive solution.  The project involves WiFi tags for children and smartphone apps for parents, caregivers and volunteers. This team prototyped the technology with all of the components of a child tag prototype plus the smartphone app with parent mode, caregiver mode, and a volunteer mode. In addition to the main focus, child protection, the team will explore other markets of the proposed innovation such as pet owners, amusement parks, malls, educational institutions, retail, and hospitals. In addition to direct manufacturing and distribution, the team is open to licensing the proposed technology to other location tracking device makers.

    Materials innovation is a pipeline, deriving from a deep understanding and control of material behavior and properties, leading to advanced materials designs that advance economic prosperity, address national and regional energy needs, and bolster national security. Improving this pipeline requires connecting independent but thematically congruent national and regional materials design efforts to align key stakeholders, consolidate diverse materials data expertise, simplify data access, coalesce on topics of data description and interoperability, enhance and ensure the quality of datasets, and deploy scalable data services to support materials researchers. The Midwest Big Data Spoke (MBD Spoke) for Integrative Materials Design (IMaD) connects researchers in industry, universities, and government to the people and services needed to easily find, access, and use data, tools, and services for materials design. The Midwest is the ideal place for such a program. Many major national materials design efforts funded by DOE, NIST, and NSF as part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) operate in the Midwest, and the Midwest is home to major manufacturing industries that depend critically on materials innovation for their continued competitiveness.

    The technical work of IMaD will involve integration of software and services from across the Midwest and beyond, including the Materials Commons, the Materials Data Facility, NIST Materials Resource Registry, and Citrine Informatics, to enable smooth flow of software and data among these different systems. For example, integrated authentication provided by Globus Auth will enable access to different components with common credentials (e.g., institutional credentials), and integration of Globus transfer will allow for rapid and reliable exchange of large datasets. Common schemas and metadata terms will be developed and deployed to permit cross-system searching and display of information. Materials data from partners across the Midwest and beyond will be loaded into the Material Data Facility to permit easy discovery and access. Concurrently with these and other development activities, a series of workshops and meetings will be convened to engage academic, government, and industry participants in defining requirements for, and making use of, the integrated system for materials design.

- abstractText: |-
    Materials innovation is a pipeline, deriving from a deep understanding and control of material behavior and properties, leading to advanced materials designs that advance economic prosperity, address national and regional energy needs, and bolster national security. Improving this pipeline requires connecting independent but thematically congruent national and regional materials design efforts to align key stakeholders, consolidate diverse materials data expertise, simplify data access, coalesce on topics of data description and interoperability, enhance and ensure the quality of datasets, and deploy scalable data services to support materials researchers. The Midwest Big Data Spoke (MBD Spoke) for Integrative Materials Design (IMaD) connects researchers in industry, universities, and government to the people and services needed to easily find, access, and use data, tools, and services for materials design. The Midwest is the ideal place for such a program. Many major national materials design efforts funded by DOE, NIST, and NSF as part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) operate in the Midwest, and the Midwest is home to major manufacturing industries that depend critically on materials innovation for their continued competitiveness.

    The technical work of IMaD will involve integration of software and services from across the Midwest and beyond, including the Materials Commons, the Materials Data Facility, NIST Materials Resource Registry, and Citrine Informatics, to enable smooth flow of software and data among these different systems. For example, integrated authentication provided by Globus Auth will enable access to different components with common credentials (e.g., institutional credentials), and integration of Globus transfer will allow for rapid and reliable exchange of large datasets. Common schemas and metadata terms will be developed and deployed to permit cross-system searching and display of information. Materials data from partners across the Midwest and beyond will be loaded into the Material Data Facility to permit easy discovery and access. Concurrently with these and other development activities, a series of workshops and meetings will be convened to engage academic, government, and industry participants in defining requirements for, and making use of, the integrated system for materials design.

    This project will support teachers, administrators and researchers to collaborate around online education resources and big data. It will increase the capacity of participants in Educational Big Data in the Northeast to analyze data from schools, students and administrators and to improve teaching and learning. However, as more refined data comes from online instructional systems and the use of data mining techniques, participants will learn to search for patterns and associations and to draw conclusions about student knowledge, performance and behavior. This research addresses several grand challenges in education: 1) Predict future student events, e.g., college attendance, college major, from existing large-scale longitudinal educational data sets involving the same thousands of students. 2) Help teachers to make sense of dense online data to influence their teaching, e.g., what should they say or do in response to student activity. 3) Provide personal instruction to each student based on using big data that represents student skills and behavior and infers students' cognitive, motivational, and metacognitive factors in learning. The project will improve the capacity in data-driven education by sharing educational databases, managing yearly data competitions, and conducting educational data science workshops and hackathons. Measurable results include studying gigabytes of data to: create actionable recommendations for classroom teachers; make effective and successful predictions about students; develop new AI methods for education; and create new data science tool sets. Key outcomes include introducing many researchers to educational big data, learning analytics and models of teaching interventions. The team intends to improve classroom learning and leverage the unique types of data available from digital education to better understand students, groups and the settings in which they learn.

    Computers have been in classrooms for decades and yet educators have not identified the most effective ways of using them. Despite advances in evaluation methods to measure human learning, most researchers still use measures available 50 years ago. This project will leverage and extend state-of-the-art big data bases and technologies to measure online learning, especially features of student engagement and learning associated with improved student outcome. This project has the potential to reach millions of students (while learning), hundreds of researchers while measuring human learning (from education, cognitive science, learning sciences, psychology, and computer science) and a dozen other organizations (publishers, testing organizations, non-profit organizations, teachers, parents, and stakeholders). The team brings together a unique blend of researchers from data science (Baker, Heffernan); adaptive education technology and computer science (Woolf, Arroyo); and learning sciences (Arroyo, Heffernan). It includes women and minorities (Woolf, Arroyo), people who helped develop the largest educational database in the world (Baker), developers of data science teaching materials (Arroyo, Baker), and others who have developed online tutoring systems that achieve significant student success in learning (e.g., Heffernan, Arroyo, Woolf).

- abstractText: "One of the critical challenges civil societies face is coping with
    emergencies due to natural or human-created disasters, such as major floods, tornadoes,
    or civic unrest. Resilience, the sustained ability of a community to utilize available
    resources to plan for, respond to, and recover from adverse situations, is critical
    and can be improved by a systematic, scientific process.  This project will investigate
    the potential for Big Data-- harnessed through integrated and networked data resources,
    along with the proper analytics--to benefit preparation, response, and recovery
    processes.  The project will bring together leaders in disaster response at state,
    county, and city levels with data scientists to craft a plan to capitalize on
    existing data and to utilize previously untapped data for emergency response and
    recovery.  Potential benefits include improved forecasting of incidents and their
    impacts, more efficient and effective utilization of resources, enhanced situational
    awareness during response, and improved planning for recovery.  The project will
    also define issues related to policies for data sharing and management and may
    lead to the development of new policy models.  The interaction between experienced
    emergency management personnel and data scientists will disclose novel combinations
    of data and tools that can benefit planning, response, and recovery.  The project
    also has the potential to develop a community of practice focused on data in resilience
    and incident response in several Midwestern states.  \n\nThe project will tackle
    several key challenges.  First, the data involved are \"big\" in terms of volume,
    velocity, and complexity.  Second, all emergency and disaster response is locally
    controlled in the U.S., and each jurisdiction has traditionally been responsible
    for collecting its own data regarding equipment and resources, which introduces
    variability in format and types of data collected across locales and over time.
    \ Third, data sharing across jurisdictions creates issues related to ownership
    of data and privacy that require the development of policies and administrative
    regimes.  Fourth, a great deal of the data is unstructured.  To address these
    challenges, the team will convene a representative set of stakeholders and experts
    in five step process to develop requirements and recommendations concerning the
    contributions an integrated data resource can make to community resilience.  The
    stakeholders will include leaders in emergency response and policing, public health,
    state and local government, subject matter experts, data scientists, and analysts
    representing several Midwestern states. Participants will define key questions,
    the types of data needed to answer them, and what outputs would be contribute
    to resilience.   The team will also identify a comprehensive list of stakeholders
    who should be involved in a full project and metrics for measuring success of
    the project.  Participating states include Illinois, Indiana, and North Dakota.
    \ The product will be a plan set to take this effort to the next stage, implementation
    of data resources for community resilience in the face of disaster and emergencies."

- abstractText: "An inherent feature of the modernization of America's electrical
    power grid is a rapidly emerging Big Data (BD) presence. The American Recovery
    and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 allocated over $4 billion to deployment of
    new technology for grid monitoring, control and infrastructure protection.  This
    led to a dramatic proliferation in the use of Big Data across multiple operational
    domains such as generation, transmission and distribution, customers, services,
    and markets. A challenging goal is to convert Big Data in smart grids, which is
    overwhelmingly abundant and yet grossly underutilized, into new knowledge that
    can offer major improvements in the above mentioned domains of smart grid operation,
    including management of almost a trillion dollars in grid infrastructure annually
    and an increase in building energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020. The Smart
    Grids BD (SGBD) Spoke will build an action-oriented organization focused on developing
    the fundamental framework for BD integration and knowledge extraction for power
    system applications. This will enable the South Big Data Hub to meet the societal
    grand challenge of creating technological solutions that can fulfill the economic
    potential inherent in Big Data analytics in the electric utility industry, expected
    to reach an annual value of close to $4 billion by 2020. The Project mission is
    to complement, strengthen, and serve the South Hub regional priority areas. Moreover,
    the services of the Spoke will benefit and complement the other Hub regional priority
    areas dependent on a smart grid backbone for operational assurance and resilience,
    specifically the areas of Oil and Gas Production and Distribution, National Hazards

    and Education and Training.  \n\nThe significance of Smart Grids Big Data is in
    the diversity of its sources, growth rate, and spatiotemporal characteristics.
    Developing a fundamental framework for Big Data integration and knowledge extraction
    is a grand challenge since the science and technology are yet to be discovered
    and the theoretical framework established. The main objective is to create an
    organization that brings together a cross disciplinary capability from academia,
    industry, and government, thereby (a) bringing  talent and resources from diverse
    Big Data areas to create an open access Big Data infrastructure that enables collaboration
    and innovation; (b) engaging industry to define its challenges and implement new
    Big Data technologies for cost-effective computational, analytical, and data management
    solutions needed to get the full benefits of smart grids; and (c) establishing
    close collaboration with the South Hub to find the most effective way to develop
    outreach, education, and training, thereby assuring the SGBD SPOKE domain integrates
    synergistically with the other Hub domains to advance fundamental data science
    and its impacts.   Achieving the knowledge extraction from Smart Grids Big Data
    will result in the advancement of fundamental sciences in multiple disciplinary
    domains related to Big Data analytics. It will also increase our understanding
    of merged data collected from the physical systems, thereby helping us better
    understand the flow of energy in the smart grids, and how this understanding can
    prevent emergencies, improve asset management, and increase energy efficiency.
    It will also provide a more illuminated understanding of behavioral analytics

    transformational outcomes are: (a) solutions to decreasing the grid outages, improving
    energy and market efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, and engaging industry
    and customers in new business models to ensure industry growth, operational resiliency,
    and customer value, (b) a cross cutting research community focused on solving

    The Digital Agriculture Spoke of the Midwest Big Data Hub seeks to organize academic, industrial, and governmental sectors around the development of policies and best practices for data science and Big Data applications in agriculture, with a particular focus on automating the Big Data lifecycle for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and for plant sciences, phenomics, and genomics. This effort is necessitated by the projected growth in the global population (9.5 billion people by 2050), which will require the global agricultural workforce to produce 70% more food than our farmers do today. Historically, agricultural revolutions in cultivation, social organization, and industrialization have provided the means to increase food production. However, future revolutions must leverage the advantages provided by the modern information society. This project will serve as a catalyst for this data-driven revolution, which will be broad and societal in nature and address the triple-bottom line of being economically viable, socially acceptable, and environmentally sensible. Whereas the initial focus areas are specific, the resulting best practices and partnership-building will translate to and enable other areas such as remote sensing systems and farm management techniques.  An expected outcome is improved and efficient use of UAS, imaging, and genomics in agricultural sciences, ultimately leading to a more sustainable global food and nutrition system. Coordination of these activities will be enhanced through a Digital Agriculture open web portal of data science resources, designed to integrate existing information silos, facilitate collaboration, and contribute to workforce development. Educational activities and tools will be leveraged from pre-existing traineeship programs and collaborative entities, and broadened with newly developed annual workshops. Special issue-teams of academic, industrial, and governmental representatives will be used to conduct deep-learning analysis of project educational activities to identify and refine mechanisms for broadening and diversifying participation. Through these efforts, the collaboration will improve access to data assets, train a workforce with relevant skills and expertise, and will contribute to solving the Sustainable Global Food and Nutrition Security challenge.

    This project will focus on two knowledge domains important to agriculture, UAS, and Plant Sciences. These two themes of Intellectual Merit will be melded with cross-cutting activities designed to improve the management, accessibility, automation, and value of the lifecycle for data that are generated by multiple, high-throughput sensor and measurement platforms in contexts related to agriculture and agriculture production. Best practices for transport, storage, dissemination, and analysis of Big Data will be translatable and scalable to other areas such as farm management systems and precision agriculture, and will enable the access to and use of valuable data assets related to UAS and plant sciences, thereby accelerating progress toward sustainable agricultural production. Many of the ideas and methods developed under this project and the partnership-building activities that link multiple public institutions and private entities will be transferable to other disciplines that require Big Data, such as transportation, health sciences, and food, energy, and water, and will therefore generate innovation and discovery from many and complex data resources. One aspect of these partnerships is the desire to build a workforce with strong data science skillsets. To accomplish this, project activities include participation by undergraduate, graduate, and early career scientists in annual meetings, Zoom events, and webinars. Interested participants from the academic, industrial, and governmental sectors will be supported and encouraged to engage in cutting-edge research and development areas such as direct data collection of plant features by UAS, biological feature extraction through image analysis, Big Data processing pipelines, and techniques for data management and sharing. Diversity of innovation related to UAS and Plant Sciences will be encouraged through a suite of issue teams who analyze in-person and web-based trainings, goal-oriented Meetups, and conference events for diversity using deep learning techniques. These modalities for deep learning were selected for their scalability and improved access by underrepresented groups. The project has a heavy emphasis on workforce training and best practices. Workshops and webinars, including hackathons and datathons, will help both students and people already in the workforce expand their professional development.

    Computation and Data Synthesis'
- abstractText: |-
    Today, scientists within numerous biophysical and agricultural sciences utilize sensors to collect a multitude of data including weather, plant pathogens, energy distribution and water consumption, and apply data management techniques to derive additional knowledge. A critical requirement for the use of such data is to make sure that data do not have errors, are accurate, complete and up to date. Low quality data may be caused by a variety of real world issues including faulty equipment, software faults, or adverse environmental conditions. However manually validating data quality is not viable for very large sensor systems with high volumes of generated data, and delays in validation may result in losing data which is impossible to regenerate due to changing temporal conditions. Also in scientific research it is today critical that research processes be reproducible in order to validate research results and detect scientific frauds.  Research reproducibility is particularly challenging for experiments that include sensors because re-creating the same physical conditions in which data has been captured may often be difficult if possible at all. This project aims at creating and fostering a multi-disciplinary community focusing on data quality and research results reproducibility for sensor-based experiments. Two workshops will be organized to define the foundational concepts and requirements for data quality and research reproducibility, and to identify related requirements for the development of suitable cyberinfrastructures (CI). Initial approaches will be tested within the CRIS system, developed at Purdue University, as a scalable CI, and advances will be demonstrated in an integrated pilot system and tested at the Purdue University ACRE research and education facility.

    The project will result in an understanding of the requirements that a CI must address in order to support data quality and research results reproducibility also when sensors are part of the CI. These requirements will lead to scientific advances in several areas including: data quality for big data; data quality assessment for sensor-originated data; management techniques for sensor-based experiments; extended metadata for research results reproducibility; scientific workflows systems. The project will also result in advances in the use of CI in the area of agriculture applications with respect to the use of sensors and to the quality of data. Our project will have a broader impact on any data-intensive application, especially applications characterized by big interrelated data, as data inter-relationships offer interesting opportunities for data quality. The project will contribute to the discussion on research results reproducibility in that it will show CI tools that can help reproducibility.

    Vast quantities of health, environmental, and behavioral data are being generated today, yet they remain locked in digital silos. For example, data from health care providers, such as hospitals, provide a dynamic view of health of individuals and populations from birth to death. At the same time, government institutions and industry have released troves of economic, environmental, and behavioral datasets, such as indicators of income/poverty, adverse exposure (e.g., air pollution), and ecological factors (e.g., climate) to the public domain. How are economic, environmental, and behavioral factors linked with health? This project will put together numerous sources of large environmental and clinical data streams to enable the scientific community to address this question. By breaking current data silos, the broader scientific impacts will be wide. First, this effort will foster new routes of biomedical investigation for the big data community. Second, the project will enable discoveries that will have behavioral, economic, environmental, and public health relevance.

    This project will aim to assemble a first-ever data warehouse containing numerous health/clinical, environmental, behavioral, and economic data streams to ultimately enable causal discovery between these data sources. First, the team will integrate numerous health data streams by leveraging the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, www.ohdsi.org) network, a virtual data repository that contains millions of longitudinal patient measurements, such as drugs and disease diagnoses. Second, the team will build a centralized data warehouse that contains important environmental, behavioral, and economic data across the United States, such as the Environmental Protection Agency air pollution AirData, the United States Census data on income and occupation statistics, and the National Oceanic Administration Association for climate and weather-related information. Third, the team will disseminate emerging computational methods for causal inference and machine learning to enable researchers to find causal links between environmental, economic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The team will leverage our broad collaborative network consisting of academic big data researchers, federal-level institutes (e.g., EPA, NOAA), and hospitals (e.g., Partners HealthCare) to integrate these data and to disseminate cutting edge machine learning tools. Lastly, the project will create training resources (e.g., interactive how-to guides), coordinate cross-institution student internships, and lead a hands-on workshop to demonstrate use of the integrated data warehouse. The ultimate goal of the project is to facilitate community-led and collaborative causal discovery through dissemination of integrated and open big data and analytics tools.

    This project brings together six universities to design and construct a patient-focused and personalized health system that addresses the fractured nature of healthcare information, and the lack of engagement of individuals in their own healthcare. By taking advantage of the enormous amount of information being created about our environment, through the confluence of real-time, mobile and wearable devices and the availability of rich social media data on patient behavior, the team will create a detailed and comprehensive picture of a patient's health, and a tool to help manage patients' engagement with their health care providers. The system has four key aims to: (1) provide a human-centered approach for integrating electronic health record data generated by traditional methods with data collected "in the wild" (such as personal fitness devices, mobile phone usage, local weather, pollution or even fast food restaurant maps, etc.); (2) develop a framework for deciding which data sources are trustworthy; (3) create a cloud-based system to allow users to view and track their own data over time and improve healthcare outcomes; and (4) provide educational outreach and community participation, particularly in minority populations, to design a system which benefits users in both the short term (through employment and education) and the long term (through increased engagement and trust).

    This project will leverage modern distributed cloud-based computing infrastructure (including mobile phones and Amazon Web Services), and the unique capacities of the South BD Hub to house and analyze the enormous volumes of health-related data that are generated every day by people, and their environment. By linking electronic medical records, external databases and data 'in the wild' harvested from patient's Internet-enabled devices, the project will address several issues related to the integration of high-resolution data for longitudinal tracking of patients. These include acceptability of the technology, particularly by vulnerable groups, usability, veracity of data collected, and scalability/integration across a large heterogeneous landscape.  By employing patient-centric agile development, the team will work with communities to implement a cloud-based architecture to improve tracking of study participants, increase the ease with which data can be captured, improve patient engagement, and facilitate care coordination. The resultant platform will integrate big data analytics, real time scalable data collection, and social media analytics on patient behavior to analyze cardiovascular disease outcomes among disadvantaged African American and Hispanic patient populations.  Additionally, the team will implement data fusion techniques to ensure the veracity of the varying qualities of data collected, and develop machine learning models to identify at-risk patient populations in order to reduce health disparities. Finally, patient engagement and health outcomes will be measured to assess the validity and success of the system.

    Factors and Causal Reasoning Approaches for Large-Scale Observational Health Research'
- abstractText: |-
    Vast quantities of health, environmental, and behavioral data are being generated today, yet they remain locked in digital silos. For example, data from health care providers, such as hospitals, provide a dynamic view of health of individuals and populations from birth to death. At the same time, government institutions and industry have released troves of economic, environmental, and behavioral datasets, such as indicators of income/poverty, adverse exposure (e.g., air pollution), and ecological factors (e.g., climate) to the public domain. How are economic, environmental, and behavioral factors linked with health? This project will put together numerous sources of large environmental and clinical data streams to enable the scientific community to address this question. By breaking current data silos, the broader scientific impacts will be wide. First, this effort will foster new routes of biomedical investigation for the big data community. Second, the project will enable discoveries that will have behavioral, economic, environmental, and public health relevance.

    This project will aim to assemble a first-ever data warehouse containing numerous health/clinical, environmental, behavioral, and economic data streams to ultimately enable causal discovery between these data sources. First, the team will integrate numerous health data streams by leveraging the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, www.ohdsi.org) network, a virtual data repository that contains millions of longitudinal patient measurements, such as drugs and disease diagnoses. Second, the team will build a centralized data warehouse that contains important environmental, behavioral, and economic data across the United States, such as the Environmental Protection Agency air pollution AirData, the United States Census data on income and occupation statistics, and the National Oceanic Administration Association for climate and weather-related information. Third, the team will disseminate emerging computational methods for causal inference and machine learning to enable researchers to find causal links between environmental, economic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The team will leverage our broad collaborative network consisting of academic big data researchers, federal-level institutes (e.g., EPA, NOAA), and hospitals (e.g., Partners HealthCare) to integrate these data and to disseminate cutting edge machine learning tools. Lastly, the project will create training resources (e.g., interactive how-to guides), coordinate cross-institution student internships, and lead a hands-on workshop to demonstrate use of the integrated data warehouse. The ultimate goal of the project is to facilitate community-led and collaborative causal discovery through dissemination of integrated and open big data and analytics tools.

    The MetroInsight project is building an end to end system for knowledge discovery from real-time data streams collected through a variety of sensors, data collection and aggregation methods.  These data streams are highly dimensional with multiple sensors observing same or similar phenomena over multiple sensory spectrums and scales. These are also sometimes real-time and/or have strong timing relationships that is necessary to support metropolitan infrastructure through effective analytics and policy support. The project brings together a diverse number of partners utilities, universities, companies and cities with the ability to contribute novel tools and urban sensor data and to translate knowledge into actions. MetroInsight's unique combination of tools, data and partnerships, in part with the MetroLab Network , makes it well poised to set an example for the MetroLab programs across the nation as well as the rest of the municipal governments. The project will explore connections between multimodal datasets and urban infrastructure management to build a practical system consisting of integrated tools, as well as training a new generation of metropolitan workforce. As part of an ambitious plan for community building and workforce development, the project includes creation of new learning modules, certification programs on energy and sustainability, an online courses on sensor data analytics and new capstone projects in a new Data Science master's degree program.

    To achieve project goals, MetroInsight is building infrastructure for managing data, networks and processing that will support design of new algorithms and tools in the project. Specifically, the project is developing algorithms to transform multimodal urban data to a lower dimensional data that reflects underlying physical and social phenomena. These low dimensional data may consist of population level data suitable for dynamic processing to support real time monitoring and visualization by cityscale operators of various lifelines from transportation, communications to emergency response. To address technical challenges in complex and subtle spatiotemporal dynamics of interdependent urban networks, MetroInsight will develop metadata methods and tools that support discovery of operational interdependencies, quantification of uncertainties for decision support and to provide assurances related to integrity and security of data, compliance related to ethical and legal privacy expectations.

    Sharing of data sets can provide tremendous mutual benefits for industry, researchers and nonprofit organizations. For example, companies can profit from the fact that university researchers explore their data sets and make discoveries, which help the company to improve their business. At the same time, researchers are always on the search for real world data sets to show that their newly developed techniques work in practice. Unfortunately, many attempts to share relevant data sets between different stakeholders in industry and academia fail or require a large investment to make data sharing possible. A major obstacle is that data often comes with prohibitive restrictions on how it can be used (requiring e.g., the enforcement of legal terms or other policies, handling data privacy issues, etc.). In order to enforce these requirements today, lawyers are usually involved in negotiation the terms of each contract. It is not atypical that this process of creating an individual contract for data sharing ends up in protracted negotiations, which are both disconnected from what the actual stakeholders aim to do and fraught as both sides struggle with the implications and possibilities of modern security, privacy, and data sharing techniques. Worse, fear of missing a loophole in how the data might be (mis)used often prevents many data sharing efforts from even getting off the ground. To address these challenges, our new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. This effort has two key components:(1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) Developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses. We believe these efforts will have a transformative impact on how data sharing takes place. By moving data out of the silos of individuals and single organizations and into the hands of broader society, we can tackle many societally significant problems.

    This new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. Many services and platforms that provide access to data sets exist already today. However, these platforms generally promote completely open access and do not address the aforementioned issues that arise when dealing with proprietary data. Thus, the effort has three key components: (1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses, and (3) developing and integrating relevant metadata that will accompany the datasets shared under the different licenses, making them easily searchable and interpretable. To ensure that the developed tools and licenses are useful, the project will form the Northeast Data Sharing Group, comprising of many different stakeholders to make the licensing model widely accepted and usable in many application domains (e.g., health and finance). The intellectual merit of this proposal is to design a licensing model and a data sharing platform that is widely accepted and usable as a template in many different domains. While there exist other efforts to enable data sharing (e.g., Creative Commons), they focus on the case where the data owner is willing to openly share the data on the Internet. This licensing model and the ecosystem is different since it allows data owners to enforce certain requirements stated in a data sharing agreement (e.g., on who is allowed to access the data) and also provides tools to make data sharing of sensitive information safe. The licenses and software we propose to investigate will make it easier for organizations to open up their data to the appropriate organizations, while maintaining the ability to ensure it is protected, that access is revocable, and that access controls and audit logs are maintained.

    Poor use of data in the public sector, in general, have been linked to lack of resources and the lack of political will necessary for more efficient and effective use of data. This is troubling, given the potential of big data to increase the transparency of government decision making to all those impacted by policy implementation. Criminal Justice is one field shifting its practices in an attempt to make its decision making process more transparent to community residents, particularly with the use of community oriented policing (COP).  Recent headlines demonstrate the urgent need for police departments to build and maintain trust with their communities through greater transparency and effectiveness.  Data, when used to augment police services in a transparent fashion, has been shown to lead to heightened levels of community trust and reduce negative interactions between police officers and community members. This planning grant project seeks to identify the challenges and opportunities of utilizing big data in the criminal justice system, specifically in COP through the identification and creation of key stakeholder teams, or nodes, and a systematic participatory process with three workshops designed to elicit information, data needs, and challenges and opportunities for the viability of big data and community policing in the Western US. At the completion of the project, the team and nodes will have identified a list of concrete and systemic opportunities for utilizing big data for policing.

    The use of big data in the criminal justice system has the potential to address this problem by augmenting COP practices through increased efficiency in resource allocation.  The intellectual merit gained from this planning grant will further link big data and criminal justice by identifying systematic obstacles from diverse sectors to adopting big data strategies.  Technological innovations such as big data are often misunderstood or misapplied by policy makers, and the general public. Because of its participatory nature, this planning grant has the opportunity to more broadly impact society by engaging and informing a diverse audience around the conversation of big data. The project team also hopes to reach underrepresented groups associated with the science of big data and policy decision-making.

    Many well-known diseases can be caused by genetic variants (such as point mutations) that affect important protein features such as enzyme active sites. The scientific community has catalogued millions of genetic variants (in genomic databases) and thousands of protein structures (in the Protein Data Bank). However, these two types of information are not linked, or easily linkable, in a manner that makes it easy to explore the relationships between variants and their structural locations. Integrative research, including genetic variation and protein sequence and 3D structure, has been rare or just focusing on a few proteins individually. In this planning project we will promote and facilitate interactions between experts from these communities with the shared goal of developing methods for integrating these data comprehensively. The project will lay groundwork for precision medicine efforts, and will have a significant impact on research on many species for which exploration of the genetic variation among strains or breeds is important. Furthermore, this project will directly impact education: we currently teach several courses per year in proteomics informatics and systems biology, and we will create and use redistributable teaching modules to help students learn to apply these concepts to their research.

    Our proposed methodology will enable researchers to "think beyond linear" when interpreting genetic variation. There is currently a strong tendency for scientists in the genomic and mass-spectrometry proteomics communities to think about genome function in linear terms. However, the functional implications of variants (and post-translational modifications) are strongly influenced by their 3-dimensional location on a protein structure. Due to the lack of readily available tools, this leap from a linear position to a 3-dimensional location is rarely made. Our infrastructure will enable analysis at all scales, from mapping individual variants to a single protein, to mapping millions of variants to all available protein sequences and structures. This will in turn enable the discovery and interpretation of spatial patterns as a function of variant frequencies, affected amino acids, tendency to be post-translationally modified, and location within substructures.

    This project is to conduct the planning needed to develop a Big Data Spoke focused on energy sector innovations using big data. The project group will bring together interests and strengths on building and data center energy usage informatics, grids and demand management and alternate and future energy sources along with storage methodologies. The primary outcomes of the project will be the development of a series of partnerships to leverage new and existing data science methodologies and inspire new research on such methodologies driven by the core needs of the energy sector.  The project will focus the setup of these partnerships using the well-defined problems arising from utility provisioning for a brown-field redevelopment in the South Buffalo area that is a critical part of the transformative economic resurgence currently underway. Spoke planning activity will take the form of a series of "mini-workshops" that define the needs followed by a series of "consulting engagements" to be supported by project personnel and partners that can address needs in different aspects of the challenge problem. The engagement of private sector (utility companies, brownfield investors and tenants), non-governmental organizations and academics (from 6 universities across the region) will provide a clear understanding of capabilities and issues at the end of the planning exercise. The Northeast Big Data Hub will provide essential support in forming these partnerships, logistics for the engagement processes and providing access to the skills in many core areas like data sharing, ethics, privacy and education.

    The Project will support brownfield redevelopment that will revitalize large swaths of Buffalo will have an immediate impact on the economic well being of upstate New York and the region. Many communities commonly encounter the issues involved in such development and our solutions will have a large set of beneficiaries in the long term. The successful formation of the many partnerships needed to accomplish this will then go on to serve many other communities in the data and information needs of the energy sector in the North east and beyond. There will also be a large engagement of students and early career professionals from the universities involved.

- abstractText: "Increasingly, the prosperity, innovation and security of individuals
    and communities depend on a big data literate society. Yet conspicuously absent
    from the big data revolution is the field of teaching and learning. The revolution
    in big data must match a complementary revolution in a new kind of literacy, through
    a significant infusion of STEM education with the kinds of skills that the revolution
    in 21st century data-driven science demands. This project represents a concerted
    effort to determine what it means to be a big data literate citizen, information
    worker, researcher, or policymaker; to identify the quality of learning resources
    and programs to improve big data literacy; and to chart a path forward that will
    bridge big data practice with big data learning, education and career readiness.
    \n\nThrough a process of inquiry research and capacity-building, New York Hall
    of Science will bring together experts from member institutions of the Northeast
    Big Data Innovation Hub to galvanize big data communities of practice around education,
    identify and articulate the nature and quality of extant big data education resources
    and draft a set of big data literacy principles. The results of this planning
    process will be a planning document for a Big Data Literacy Spoke that will form
    an initiative to develop frameworks, strategies and scope and sequence to advance
    lifelong big data literacy for grades P-20 and across learning settings; and devise,
    implement, and evaluate programs, curricula and interventions to improve big data
    literacy for all. The planning document will articulate the findings of the inquiry
    research and evaluation to provide a practical tool to inform and cultivate other
    initiatives in data literacy both within the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub
    and beyond."

- abstractText: "Bridges across the U.S. continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate
    and the American Society of Civil Engineers estimate a cost of over $76 billion
    to improve the country's functionally obsolete or structurally deficient bridges.
    This indicates a significant demand for innovative bridge health monitoring solutions
    that can strategically guide management, maintenance and replacement programs
    without risking public safety. Unfortunately, the need to improve how our bridges
    are managed and repaired or replaced faces similar issues and demands as the rest
    of the U.S. transportation network: continuously shrinking resources and governing
    bodies who do not have the necessary insights from bridge health data to find
    a workable solution. \n\nTo discuss how to address these critical problems, researchers,
    practitioners, and individuals representing public and private sectors (transportation
    infrastructure and built environment owners, operators, designers and maintainers)
    convened with Big Data technology and analytics experts participated at the inaugural
    BRIDGE-ing Big Data Workshop hosted by the University of Nebraska in October 2015.
    During this workshop, it became clear that Big Data technology could assist with
    providing a timely solution. It also was apparent that past efforts focusing on
    utilizing bridge health monitoring and big data techniques as part of the management
    and maintenance/replacement processes are fragmented, and resulting datasets are
    not deemed trustworthy and are under-utilized. This project will (1) catalog datasets
    including sources, copyrights, license, collection procedures, and expected access
    controls from private sector, academia, and government agencies, (2) obtain commitments
    from stakeholders and host collaboration workshops with small working groups to
    discuss, import/export, and share bridge structural health monitoring data, and
    (3) solicit proposals from businesses/researchers to develop innovative applications
    that integrate disparate and voluminous data sources. It is anticipated that this
    project's findings will benefit the Midwest Big Data Hub transportation spoke
    and potentially inform similar activities for highways, buildings, power distribution
    networks and other civil infrastructure entities. Findings from this project will
    be promoted to national and international technical organizations, to directly
    impact workforce development, education and research programs. Combined, this
    project will make a direct impact on our country's ability to efficiently maintain
    the health and safety of its bridges."

    This project supports teachers, administrators and researchers to collaborate around online education resources and big data. It will increase the capacity of participants in Educational Big Data in the Northeast to analyze data from schools, students and administrators and to improve teaching and learning. However, as more refined data comes from online instructional systems and the use of data mining techniques, participants will learn to search for patterns and associations and to draw conclusions about student knowledge, performance and behavior. This research addresses several grand challenges in education: 1) Predict future student events, e.g., college attendance, college major, from existing large-scale longitudinal educational data sets involving the same thousands of students. 2) Help teachers to make sense of dense online data to influence their teaching, e.g., what should they say or do in response to student activity. 3) Provide personal instruction to each student based on using big data that represents student skills and behavior and infers students' cognitive, motivational, and metacognitive factors in learning. The project will improve the capacity in data-driven education by sharing educational databases, managing yearly data competitions, and conducting educational data science workshops and hackathons. Measurable results include studying gigabytes of data to: create actionable recommendations for classroom teachers; make effective and successful predictions about students; develop new AI methods for education; and create new data science tool sets. Key outcomes include introducing many researchers to educational big data, learning analytics and models of teaching interventions. The team intends to improve classroom learning and leverage the unique types of data available from digital education to better understand students, groups and the settings in which they learn.

    Computers have been in classrooms for decades and yet educators have not identified the most effective ways of using them. Despite advances in evaluation methods to measure human learning, most researchers still use measures available 50 years ago. This project will leverage and extend state-of-the-art big data bases and technologies to measure online learning, especially features of student engagement and learning associated with improved student outcome. This project has the potential to reach millions of students (while learning), hundreds of researchers while measuring human learning (from education, cognitive science, learning sciences, psychology, and computer science) and a dozen other organizations (publishers, testing organizations, non-profit organizations, teachers, parents, and stakeholders). The team brings together a unique blend of researchers from data science (Baker, Heffernan); adaptive education technology and computer science (Woolf, Arroyo); and learning sciences (Arroyo, Heffernan). It includes women and minorities (Woolf, Arroyo), people who helped develop the largest educational database in the world (Baker), developers of data science teaching materials (Arroyo, Baker), and others who have developed online tutoring systems that achieve significant student success in learning (e.g., Heffernan, Arroyo, Woolf).
